## Decision — complete inactive Route 3 role series accepted — 2026-10-14

Peter Duscha accepts the complete inactive Route 3 role series for continued
development: shared cleanup/`stop-post`, `backstop`, and `hold`, including the
GRR inspection- and descriptor-close exception-safety remediations. Independent
review found no remaining finding, and the final executable comparisons
introduced no Route 3 regression against the established repository baseline.

This decision closes the current role implementation and review sequence. It
does not authorize production or staging activation. Before activation, the
selected `tmpfiles.d` Polkit ordering must be installed and proved across a real
reboot, the transient inspection-failure risk needs an explicit decision, and
the completed series needs an independent security review. Baseline v1.9,
product scope and the production safety boundary are unchanged.

## Decision — Route 3 backstop accepted; hold proceeds — 2026-10-13

Peter Duscha accepts the independently reviewed and remediated Route 3
`backstop` slice and its Q6-7 behavior: an unconfirmed terminal DI-4 result is
reported and left, is never retried within that firing and is never described as
stopped; later firings remain terminal until the bounded journal cap.

For the observed polkitd-127 behavior, Peter accepts a `tmpfiles.d` entry
(`d /run/polkit-1/rules.d 0755 root root -`) as the preferred future
installer/activation design. Installation and real-reboot proof are deferred to
the installer/activation slice and remain required before production
activation. They are not part of the current `hold` implementation slice and
this decision authorizes no production or staging mutation.

The disposable-host `hold` harness must create the directory before Polkit
starts and may restart Polkit only as harness setup. It must separately prove
that creating the directory after Polkit starts makes AV-1 fail closed. The
holder itself must never restart or reload Polkit.

## Decision — implementation-first delivery and full disposable testing — 2026-10-12

Peter Duscha adopts baseline v1.9. The WP-1 through WP-3 research chain and its
open Q3/Q6 labels are historical inputs, not development gates. Reversible
implementation choices are made in code and proved through tests; additional
proof-document closure is not required.

All testing levels are authorized on `oracle-test`, including SSH, packages,
network, root/systemd, PostgreSQL, destructive migration and recovery drills,
failure injection and end-to-end tests. Production/staging mutation and real
secrets or player data remain excluded.

The current Route 3 adapter slice receives one implementation and remediation
cycle. Peter then decides from executable evidence whether to keep it or choose
a simpler approach.

## Decision — LIT-FULL WP-2 accepted — 2026-10-09

Peter Duscha accepts the clean independent WP-2 R5 re-review recommendation
and the cumulative R5 operation inventory as completed WP-2. The review found
no Blocking, Important or Optional findings and closed `WP2-R4-1`.

The acceptance permits preparation of a bounded WP-3 assignment for
independent review. It does not accept or activate a WP-3 prompt, authorize
WP-3 execution, authorize WP-4 through WP-7, establish concrete Route 3,
select LIT-FULL for implementation, answer Q6-6 or Q6-7, decide BC-2, or grant
host, retained-evidence or implementation authority.

## Decision — EX-1/EX-2 approved; baseline v1.8 effective — 2026-10-09

Peter Duscha adopts the Product Owner recommendation and, as Acceptance
Authority, approves EX-1 and EX-2 exactly as assessed. Their existing BC-4 uses
are effective without widening BC-4; HB-1 is accepted for EX-2; and controlled
baseline v1.8 is adopted. Both exception-specific §0.2 items are closed.

EX-3 is not selected. B2-N and a Python-free installer are not pre-WP-2
prerequisites under the selected F-1 combination. The approval changes the
design boundary only: concrete Route 3 remains unestablished, BC-2 remains
unresolved, and WP-2, host access and implementation remain unauthorized.

· [Closed change items](change-log.md).

## Decision — WP-1 accepted; BQ-2/BQ-3 recorded; §0.2 required — 2026-10-09

Peter Duscha accepts the independently reviewed cumulative R6 proposal as the
completed LIT-FULL WP-1 boundary analysis and records the recommended choices:
PD-2a is B2-F; PD-2b puts both `AP-2` and the OS-6 `stop` in the final
root-procedure set; and PD-3 is B3-OUT for H-1, RB-1, RS-1 and H-1R.

The combination selects EX-1 and EX-2, selects no EX-3, and requires neither
B2-N nor a Python-free installer design before WP-2. At this decision point,
EX-1, EX-2 and the affected BC-4 boundary were not yet effective or approved;
complete implementation-plan §0.2 change control still had to close. Concrete
Route 3 remained unestablished, BC-2 unresolved, and no host or implementation
authority was created.

The subsequent EX-1/EX-2 impact assessment and approval are recorded in the
newer decision above. This entry remains the boundary-choice record.

## Decision — LIT-FULL WP-1 R1 remediation authorized — 2026-10-07

Peter Duscha authorizes exact 7482-byte prompt SHA-256
`2724e5c19d4edf9084200dc7bde58853864b19d41fadfbebbde4a2b508f4f127`
under work ID `C-P5.0-R5-RP11-H1-OH-S3-RT3-WP1-R1-20261007-10`.

Claude must remediate Blocking WP1-R1 by restoring mandatory §0.2 change
control before WP-2 may rely on a BC-4 exception, and Important WP1-R2 through a
complete first-byte-through-EOF audit of the controlling records. The assignment
is repository documentation only and returns for independent Codex re-review.

No BQ decision, exception approval, §0.2 change, WP-1 acceptance, WP-2, host or
implementation authority is created.

## Decision — DEC-1 through DEC-6 accepted; LIT-FULL readiness commissioned — 2026-10-07

Peter Duscha accepts all six activation-design recommendations in accepted R8
§12.1 and commissions the LIT-FULL/R3-ROOT Route 3 readiness investigation,
WP-1 through WP-7 in dependency order. The decision preserves the accepted
Route 3 boundary, opens no §0.2 change and does not select LIT-FULL for
implementation.

Exact work ID `C-P5.0-R5-RP11-H1-OH-S3-RT3-WP1-20261007-09` activates WP-1
only through the 5504-byte prompt with SHA-256
`60074759b6e0ae8f41b9cf3d5ddd0f477fa960cc4cd4d7fad5f21661b0a1011e`.
WP-2 through WP-7 remain separately gated. WP-1 returns for independent Codex
review and Peter's BQ-2/BQ-3 decisions; no host or implementation authority is
created.

## Decision — cumulative OH-S3 R8 design accepted — 2026-10-07

Peter Duscha accepts Codex's independent OH-S3 R8 re-review and accepts the
cumulative R8 proposal, with the authorized R9-F1 editorial correction, as the
inactive forward design basis. `R8-F1`, `R8-F2` and `R9-F1` are closed.

The decision does not establish concrete Route 3, make DEC-1 through DEC-6 or
select the G-1b Route 3 direction. The Route 3 hard stop remains, and no
successor or operational authority is created.

## Decision — OH-S3 R1 design remediation authorized — 2026-10-07

Peter Duscha authorizes exact 9693-byte prompt SHA-256

under work ID `C-P5.0-R5-RP11-H1-OH-S3-R1-20261007-01`. Claude must repair
the activation design for PO-20(f), PO-21(c), PO-21(s) and PO-11(d), replace
Route 1 with a concrete Route 3 design, and define the MF-1 through MF-8 and
OH-S4p successor gates.

The assignment is repository documentation only and returns for independent
Codex review. No host, implementation, launcher, cleanup, activation, commit or
push authority is granted.

## Decision — R1-F1 residual risk accepted — 2026-10-07

Peter Duscha records that the deleted cookie was approximately one month old,
belonged exclusively to the already removed music capability and is no longer
needed. He accepts any residual possibility that its former remote session
remained valid and requires no invalidation or rotation. The R1-F1 incident-
response question is closed; R1 remains nonconforming history.

## Decision — obsolete music residue removed; R1-F1 response closed — 2026-10-06

Peter Duscha confirms that `yt-cookies.txt` belonged only to the music
capability removed by OD-40 and directs removal of every remaining residue.
The untracked cookie file and empty local Lavalink directory were deleted
without reading the cookie. Current music-specific operational exceptions were
removed; historical evidence was preserved. This closes the local residue;
remote-session invalidation or explicit risk acceptance remains Peter's
decision. R1 remains nonconforming history.

[Decision](../review/project-review-2026-10-06-music-residue-removal.md).

## Decision — OH-S2 R2 accepted — 2026-10-06

Peter Duscha accepts Codex's independent OH-S2 R2 re-review with no Blocking,
Important or Optional finding and accepts the cumulative R2 citation record as
the inactive forward basis. `R1-F1` and `R1-F2` are closed as remediated. R1
remains a nonconforming historical execution and R2 is not retroactive.

The accepted technical dispositions and missing-fact boundaries are unchanged.
The R1-F1 incident-response and credential-rotation question remains Peter's
decision. No successor or operational authority is created.

## Decision — R3 accepted and narrow H-0G R1 authorized — 2026-10-06

Peter Duscha accepts Codex's independent R3 review with no finding, accepts
the cumulative R3 design and closes `R2-F1` through `R2-F3` as remediated.
Peter separately authorizes exact 7881-byte H-0G prompt SHA-256
`58ebc8cb07a82d4f2c75df5dc35feb99eaf04802cc9abd1a98ffdb1104caca31`
under work ID `C-P5.0-R5-RP11-H1-OH-S0B-S1-H0G-R1-20261006-06`.

The one-shot assignment permits one forwarding-disabled SSH execution
connection and repository-free, unprivileged fact collection into the fresh
exclusive evidence path. It does not authorize cleanup, workspace recreation,
OH-S2 or later work. Its return requires independent review and composition.

complete handback and terminal current-state pointer updates. No network,
`oracle-test`, retained-evidence access, fresh H-0 fact collection,
implementation, OH-S2, H-1/H-2, activation, cleanup, commit or push is
authorized. The return requires independent Codex review and Peter's recorded
decisions.

one forwarding-disabled SSH execution connection and anonymous retrieval from
the public `freedom-platform` URL. R4 and every earlier path remain consumed.

No controller-side network preflight, retry, cleanup, credential, privilege,
installation, build, test, service/database mutation, H-1/H-2 or later slice
is authorized. The complete handback must be preserved both in its dedicated
file and verbatim in chat before independent Codex review.

## Decision — repository renamed to `freedom-platform` and made public — 2026-10-06

Peter Duscha renamed the canonical GitHub repository from
`ming-themerciless/freedom-bot` to `ming-themerciless/freedom-platform` and
made it publicly readable. Current retrieval uses
`https://github.com/ming-themerciless/freedom-platform.git`; historical records
retain the old slug when it identifies an executed or consumed assignment.

This administrative change does not rename the Freedom bot application or
service and does not authorize a new H-0 run. R4 remains consumed. A successor
requires a fresh work ID, exclusive paths and explicit authority.

## Decision — R4 isolated-checkout H-0 authorized — 2026-10-06

Peter Duscha directs routine execution details to be resolved without repeated
escalation. R4 preserves the dirty fixed checkout and uses new exclusive
`/var/tmp` checkout and evidence paths for one SSH-controlled pinned retrieval
and H-0 collection. It records the available `/usr/bin/python3` rather than
assuming Python 3.12 and must produce a durable file-backed terminal handback.
OH-S2 and every later slice remain gated on independent review.

## Record — R3 H-0 consumed at dirty-checkout HARD STOP — 2026-10-05

R3 used its one authorized SSH connection and correctly stopped at Phase 1
because the fixed checkout was not clean. Independent review accepts the
substantive HARD STOP but not the visibly truncated terminal text as a complete
literal evidence record. No retry, cleanup, fresh checkout or later slice is
authorized. Peter must separately choose any successor route.

## Decision — direct SSH-controlled OH-S0b/OH-S1 H-0 authorized — 2026-10-05

Peter Duscha authorizes workspace Claude to remain on the controller and send
one self-contained H-0 program through exactly one forwarding-disabled,
non-interactive SSH execution connection to `oracle-test`. The retained program
runs locally as `ubuntu@Test`, retrieves the pin directly from the canonical
public repository and creates all evidence remotely. No nested Claude client,
repository transfer, credential forwarding, second connection or retry is
authorized. R2 is withdrawn unused. This exception changes H-0 orchestration
only; H-1 and later topology remain unchanged.

Peter Duscha authorizes Claude to execute corrected work ID
`C-P5.0-R5-RP11-H1-OH-S0B-S1-H0-R1-20261005-04` locally on `oracle-test` as
`ubuntu`. The identity check compares `uname -n` with kernel nodename `Test`.
The assignment may anonymously retrieve only the pinned commit from the fixed
canonical public HTTPS repository and then collect HF-01 through HF-20 into its
new exclusive evidence directory. It ends at `H-0 PASS` or `HARD STOP`.

Claude returned `EVIDENCE REPAIR COMPLETE` for work ID
`C-P5.0-ORACLE-AGENT-CLIENT-BOOTSTRAP-R1-20261005-03`. The one-shot authority
is consumed. The substantive remediation facts are recorded as verified and
the original evidence procedure remains nonconforming. Because the transmitted
handback still contains truncated command text and fields, it is not accepted
as the complete literal corrected record required by its prompt. No retry or
H-0 authority follows.

## Decision — retained bootstrap-remediation evidence repair authorized — 2026-10-05

Peter Duscha authorizes Claude to execute the exact one-shot retained-evidence
repair under work ID
`C-P5.0-ORACLE-AGENT-CLIENT-BOOTSTRAP-R1-20261005-03`. The authority is limited
to the fixed evidence paths, bounded absence checks and exclusive new evidence

retrieve pinned commit `46d1c35a029ca8287779ae87d08a370ba0a0f2ef`
anonymously from the canonical public repository, then collect the accepted
H-0 fact set without privilege. Authentication or any need for a credential is
a HARD STOP. The authority is one-shot and ends at `H-0 PASS` or `HARD STOP`.

## Decision — D3-R6 accepted; H-1 design remediation chain closed — 2026-10-04

Peter Duscha accepts Codex's clean independent D3-R6 re-review and the
cumulative one-host H-1 activation design. `OH-H1-D3-R5-1`,
`OH-H1-D3-R4-1`, `OH-H1-D3-R2-1`, `OH-H1-D3-R1-1` and `OH-H1-D3-2` are
closed as remediated. OS-6 remains decided. CX-4 is knowingly accepted as a
residual outside A-2 and not as an authorized-path exception.

The proposal becomes the accepted inactive design basis. OH-S1/H-0 is the
next proposed separately authorized slice; no host, implementation or
execution authority is granted by this decision.

## Superseded decision — OH-D-10 start-consumed grant; R4 assigned — 2026-10-04

Peter Duscha accepts Codex's D3-R3 re-review with no finding, closes
`OH-H1-D3-R2-2` as remediated and decides OH-D-10 as Option A with
interruption route iii-a. The inactive design must grant `start` only and
consume and PK-verify that grant before `ExecStart=`; manual interruption is
the executor's A-2-authorized root stop route. Claude is assigned the narrow
repository-only R4 incorporation and must return for independent review.

`OH-H1-D3-R2-1`, `OH-H1-D3-R1-1` and `OH-H1-D3-2` remain open. No host,
implementation, build or execution authority is granted.

Peter Duscha authorizes Claude's repository-only remediation of Blocking
findings `OH-H1-D3-1` and `OH-H1-D3-2`. Claude must incorporate the accepted
OH-D-1 through OH-D-9 dispositions, revise the inactive proposal and stop for
independent Codex re-review. No host, network, credential, implementation,
build or execution authority is granted.

## Superseded current state — one-host semantics accepted; design remediation required — 2026-10-04

Peter Duscha accepts OH-D-1 through OH-D-9 on Codex's recommendation. The
production server is confirmed as the current workspace host and is prohibited
as a source; `oracle-test` will later retrieve a pinned commit directly from
the canonical Git remote, with any required read-only credential subject to
separate authority. The remaining decisions adopt local interactive clients,
a local capture root, pre-pass retrieval, retained `NoNewPrivileges`, the
stated `ubuntu` authority limitation, one-pass/one-boot activation, automatic
activation cleanup but separately authorized H-1 rollback, and digest-bound
record return.

Claude's BLOCKED DESIGN is accepted as the terminal state, but the proposal is
not accepted as a complete H-1 design. Blocking findings `OH-H1-D3-1` and
`OH-H1-D3-2` require repository-only remediation and independent re-review.
No host, network, credential, implementation, build or execution authority is
created.

## Superseded — `oracle-test` one-host design amendment assigned — 2026-10-04

Peter Duscha authorizes Claude to prepare the repository-only amendment that
implements the selected local `oracle-test` H-1 topology in design. Claude
returns an inactive proposal or BLOCKED DESIGN for independent Codex review.
No host, implementation, build or execution authority is granted.

## Decision — H-1 topology corrected to local `oracle-test` — 2026-10-04

Peter Duscha supersedes the production-host dispositions of U-1 and U-3. The
complete H-1 installation and RP-11 evidence workflow will run locally on
disposable `oracle-test` under its existing `ubuntu` account. The production
Freedom-Blades/Foundry server is outside scope and must remain untouched. U-2
and U-4 through U-10 remain decided for the corrected topology; D9-2 remains
Complete. No host or implementation action is authorized by this correction.

## Superseded in U-1/U-3 — H-1 prerequisites and D9-2 disposition — 2026-10-04

Peter Duscha accepts the reviewed BLOCKED PREPARATION result, declares D9-2
Complete and decides U-1 through U-10. The H-1 launcher host is the
Freedom-Blades production server co-hosting Foundry, the operator is `foundry`,
and `oracle-test` remains the disposable target. The decisions select later
design direction but authorize no host or implementation action.

U-1 and U-3 are superseded by the local-`oracle-test` correction above. U-2,
U-4 through U-10 and D9-2 remain effective.

## Decision — static-launcher H-1 assignment preparation authorized — 2026-10-04

Peter Duscha authorizes Claude to perform the repository-only readiness audit
and prepare a decision-ready static-launcher H-1 installed-host evidence
assignment, or return BLOCKED PREPARATION with the exact prerequisite sequence.
Codex independently reviews the return. No implementation, host access or H-1
execution is authorized.

## Decision — static-launcher R-5 accepted; D9-3 complete — 2026-10-04

Peter Duscha accepts Gemini's complete R5 PASS and Codex's independent review.
The static-launcher independent-rebuild procedure R-5 is accepted and D9-3 is
Complete. This does not close the distinct package RAID item `P5.0-R5`, which
remains Blocking, or any later installed-host/operational gate. No host,
cleanup or H-1 authority exists.

## Decision — determinism remediation and R5 accepted; Gemini activated — 2026-10-04

Peter Duscha accepts the reviewed `cc1.v` determinism remediation, closes
`FRESH-R4-HS-1`, accepts the dated D2 amendment, confirms the R5 identifiers,
retains the R4 evidence without cleanup and leaves S10 unchanged. Focused
commit `4cbdf0b6ecabad7484e64ff0485587a17f55dcaf` satisfies the controlled-file
precondition. The exact R5 assignment is accepted and Gemini is activated for
one digest-pinned runner invocation. No other host or cleanup authority exists.

## Decision — R4 HARD STOP accepted; staged determinism remediation — 2026-10-04

Peter Duscha accepts Gemini's consumed R4 HARD STOP, Codex's independent review
and open Important finding `FRESH-R4-HS-1`. Claude is assigned repository-only
remediation of the complete `cc1.v` determinism contract. Codex independently
reviews the return. A successor Gemini run is conditionally the next stage only
after a clean review and an exact digest-pinned assignment and activation
record; no current host authority exists.

## Decision — B1-R4 and version-30 baseline contract accepted — 2026-10-02

Peter Duscha accepts Gemini's B1-R4 record remediation and corrected B1-R3
record on Codex's independent recommendation. `B1-R3-1` and `B1-R3-2` are
Closed as remediated. Manifest version 30, aggregate digest
`28a4f4c2b7596e9042f6b12a34f5684b3499a3fafd997e306fe25f6798e8a526`
and the 5,120-byte diagnostic baseline with SHA-256 `b77f92dc…905b` are accepted
as review inputs. The impossible self-hash requirement for the B1-R4 handback
is waived; Codex measured `ca2a3462…9ed1` independently.

This grants no R-5 or host authority. A fresh R-5 assignment must be prepared,
independently reviewed and explicitly accepted. R-5 remains stopped, Blocking
and unaccepted; `plan.is_executable=False`; RP-11 remains unwired and unmet;
Package 5.0 remains not ready.

## Assignment — Gemini baseline contract verification remediation (B1-R3) — 2026-10-01

Peter Duscha assigns work ID `C-P5.0-R5-RP11-I1-R3-R4-R5-B1-R3` to Gemini to
execute the baseline contract verification remediation in
`docs/review/phase-5-0-p5-r5-rp11-i1-r3-r4-r5-b1-r3-baseline-contract-verification-remediation-gemini-prompt.md`.
Gemini must remediate Finding B1-R3-1 by removing the synthetic-placeholder
bypass in `ReviewManifest.build()` so that all `cc1.v.baseline` fixture bytes
undergo exact length (5,120) and SHA-256 (`b77f92dc...905b`) verification
unconditionally, update shared test fixtures to load verified fixture bytes, add
4 regression tests, advance `MANIFEST_VERSION` to 30, remediate Finding B1-R3-2 by
producing the missing B1-R2 handback with the dated review correction note, and
produce the B1-R3 handback.

Repository source, tests, and documentation only. No `oracle-test` access,
build-root provisioning, network access, package installation, service/database
action, RP-11 wiring, operational authority, or R-5 execution. R-5 remains
stopped, unexecuted, and unaccepted; `plan.is_executable=False`; and Package 5.0
remains not ready.

## Decision — R4-R1 accepted; Option 1 reference reproduction authorized — 2026-10-01

Peter accepts Gemini's R4-R1 record correction and corrected R4 Branch B on
Codex's recommendation. No historical `cc1.v` artifact was recovered and no
fixture was created. Peter selects Option 1 and assigns Gemini a controlled
reference reproduction on the repository host, conditional on freshly matching
Claude's kernel `6.8.0-139-generic`, CPU `AMD EPYC-Milan Processor` and
bubblewrap `0.9.0`. A fixture may be retained only for exact SHA-256
`b77f92dcdcf899c5459fec606f16dc325ed5329516cbab5faea86b479992905b`.
Any mismatch stops. No `oracle-test` access or R-5 rerun is authorized; R-5
remains stopped, Blocking and unaccepted.

## Decision — R-5 R3 accepted; Gemini R4 `cc1.v` baseline recovery — 2026-10-01

Peter Duscha accepts Gemini's R3 `cc1.v` comparison remediation on Codex's
independent recommendation. R2 had introduced the same-invocation R-1/R-2 gate
and withdrawn the erroneous R-5 PASS; R3 removed the unsafe causal regex
override, so byte equality is the only route to `PASS`. Codex reproduced 4,019
passing repository tests, with 12 toolchain-dependent skips because no accepted
local root was available, plus clean compilation, byte-range checks and `git
diff --check`.

Peter authorizes Gemini only to recover Claude's historical `cc1.v` bytes with
exact SHA-256
`b77f92dcdcf899c5459fec606f16dc325ed5329516cbab5faea86b479992905b`. No
rebuild, baseline reproduction, SSH, `oracle-test`, download, provisioning or
R-5 rerun is authorized. Failure requires a handback and stop; success
authenticates only the historical artifact and neither explains Gemini's
differing `cc1.v` nor accepts R-5. R-5 remains stopped, Blocking and
unaccepted; RP-11 remains unwired and unmet; `plan.is_executable=False`; and
Package 5.0 remains not ready.
[Acceptance](../review/project-review-2026-10-01-p5-r5-rp11-r5-r3-acceptance.md).

## Assignment — Gemini R-5 R2 orchestration remediation — 2026-10-01

Peter Duscha assigns Gemini a repository-only remediation of the returned R-5
evidence. It must add the missing one-invocation R-1/R-2 manifest gate, correct
the snapshot statement, withdraw the premature PASS, and prepare exact
`cc1.v` difference handling. Gemini stops for independent review before any
new host run.

No SSH, `oracle-test`, package, provisioning or build authority exists in this
stage. R-5 remains unaccepted.
[Prompt](../review/phase-5-0-p5-r5-rp11-i1-r3-r4-r5-r2-orchestration-remediation-gemini-prompt.md).

## Decision — Gemini may install bubblewrap and resume R-5 — 2026-10-01

After Gemini correctly stopped on the missing `/usr/bin/bwrap` prerequisite,
Peter Duscha authorizes Gemini to run only `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo
apt-get install -y bubblewrap` on `oracle-test`, record the transaction and
resume the accepted R-5 assignment with entirely fresh disposable directories.

Gemini must correct Important finding `R5-R1-1` in its amended handback. No
other privilege, package, host, installation or operational authority is
created. R-5 remains incomplete and unaccepted.

## Decision — R-5 assigned to Gemini — 2026-10-01

Peter Duscha accepts the R-5 independent-rebuild prompt after Antigravity found
no Blocking or Important issue and names Gemini as the independent assignee.
Gemini may perform only the bounded `oracle-test` actions in the prompt, must
produce the prescribed handback and stop, and does not gain authority for any
later step.

This accepts the assignment, not its evidence. R-5 remains unperformed until
Gemini returns a conforming record; that record then requires independent
review and Peter's acceptance.
[Review](../review/project-review-2026-10-01-p5-r5-rp11-r5-assignment-antigravity.md).
[Acceptance](../review/project-review-2026-10-01-p5-r5-rp11-r5-assignment-acceptance.md).

## Direction — prepare R-5 independent-rebuild assignment — 2026-10-01

Peter Duscha authorizes Codex to prepare, but not execute, a bounded R-5
assignment. The proposed prompt uses `oracle-test` as the candidate independent
environment, requires fresh proof that at least one of HA-1 … HA-3 actually
differs, and preserves every LD-8 hard stop.

The prompt is not accepted or assigned. No SSH, synchronization, host
inspection, acquisition, provisioning, build, installation, operational
execution, commit or push authority is created.
[Proposed assignment](../review/phase-5-0-p5-r5-rp11-i1-r3-r4-r5-independent-rebuild-assignment.md).

## Decision — I-7-R1 accepted; exact IC-1 environment finding closed — 2026-10-01

Peter Duscha accepts Claude's I-7-R1 remediation on Codex's independent
recommendation. `I7-R1-1` is Closed as remediated and D-2 is accepted as
implemented. The accepted manifest is version 28 with aggregate digest
`02d660c3bb8cd030a36ae1ece70da0de1756ca3052f3de74c89a15279a5c5abb`.

This closes only the narrow return gate. R-5 remains unperformed and requires
a separate maintainer assignment to an independent party; it must vary and
record at least one of HA-1 … HA-3. No host, installation, H-1/H-2, PO-14,
RP-11 wiring or operational authority is created.
[Acceptance record](../review/project-review-2026-10-01-p5-r5-rp11-i7-r1-acceptance.md).
[Independent re-review](../review/project-review-2026-10-01-p5-r5-rp11-i7-r1-ic1-environment-remediation.md).

## Decision — I-7 static-launcher implementation authorized — 2026-10-01

Peter Duscha authorizes Claude to implement the accepted I-7 repository slice:
the zero-`ret` launcher, pinned build boundary, XD, T-L1 … T-L12, IC-1,
repository tests, manifest coverage and deterministic artifacts. Claude stops
after handback for independent Codex review.

This permits isolated toolchain acquisition and repository-host build,
decoder, verifier and test work as the prompt specifies. It does not authorize
Claude to satisfy independent R-5, Codex's XD-9/XD-11 duties, `oracle-test`,
installation, H-1/H-2, PO-14 discharge, RP-11 wiring or an operational pass.
[Implementation prompt](../review/phase-5-0-p5-r5-rp11-i1-r3-r4-i7-static-launcher-implementation-claude-prompt.md).

## Decision — D2-R2 accepted; LD-9 independent decoding required — 2026-10-01

Peter Duscha accepts the D2-R2 zero-`ret` and independent-decoding design after
Codex's independent review found no new Blocking or Important issue.
`R4-D2-R1-1` is Closed as remediated at the design level.

**LD-9 option (i) is decided:** at D9-2, Codex must independently decode the
actual `.text` using its own decoder or a byte-by-byte manual derivation
prepared without reading XD's table. Exercising XD alone is not sufficient.
This creates no implementation, build, host or operational authority; PO-9 and
PO-14 remain open and a separate M-14/I-7 assignment is required.
[Acceptance record](../review/project-review-2026-10-01-p5-r5-rp11-r4-d2-r2-acceptance.md).

## Decision — zero-ret launcher and bound build-root model — 2026-09-30

Peter Duscha accepts Codex's D2-R1 recommendations. **LD-7** requires FA-2's
zero-`ret` image from the first build; permitting `ret` later requires a new,
separately reviewed decision. **LD-8** accepts the bound build root plus named
residual inputs HA-1 … HA-5, provided IC-1 passes, R-5 actually varies and
records at least one of HA-1 … HA-3, unexplained differences stop, and the
independent-decoding finding is resolved. Diverse double compilation is not
required for PO-9.

New finding `R4-D2-R1-1` remains Open, Blocking: the current evidence consumes
the pinned disassembler's instruction boundaries without an independent decode
of `.text`. A documentation-only D2-R2 remediation is assigned. No
implementation, build, host or operational authority is created.
[Review and decision record](../review/project-review-2026-09-30-p5-r5-rp11-r4-d2-r1-decisions.md).

## Decision — LB-2S direction and static-launcher design commissioned — 2026-09-29

Peter Duscha accepts Codex's R4-D1-R2 review with no finding and decides M-14,
M-9 and M-10 as recommended. A documentation-only design of the compiled
static first image is commissioned; LB-2S is conditionally selected subject to
an accepted design and later discharge of PO-9 and PO-14; T-A stays in scope,
manager execution settings are explicitly trusted reviewed root input under
R-10, and T-B remains out of scope.

This creates no implementation, compilation, host or operational authority.
RP-11 remains unmet and neither pass is executable.
[Decision record](../review/project-review-2026-09-29-p5-r5-rp11-r4-d1-r2-launch-boundary-decision.md).

## Decision — R3 PosixFilesystem descriptor-release remediation accepted — 2026-09-29

Peter Duscha accepts `C-P5.0-R5-RP11-I1-R3-R3` after Codex's independent
review found no Blocking, Important or Optional issue. The post-open descriptor
leaks in `PosixFilesystem.create_file` and `openat` are closed as remediated.
Manifest version 26 and digest `526dd446…` are accepted review inputs only.

This does not approve execution, accept or wire RP-11, or change a package
gate. RP-11 remains unmet, `plan.is_executable=False`, P5.0-R5 remains Blocking
and Package 5.0 remains not ready.
[Acceptance record](../review/project-review-2026-09-29-p5-r5-rp11-i1-r3-r3-posix-post-open-release-acceptance.md).

## Decision — RP-11 Option-1 alignment accepted; legacy findings superseded — 2026-09-29

Peter Duscha accepts Codex's independent review of the corrected Option-1
documentation alignment with no finding. `RP11-I1-2`, `RP11-I1-R2-1` and
`RP11-I1-R1-1` are Closed as superseded by the accepted I1-R3 retained-alias
design.

This accepts the documentation alignment and finding dispositions only. It
does not accept or wire RP-11, authorize either operational pass, or change a
package gate. RP-11 remains unmet, `plan.is_executable=False`, P5.0-R5 remains
Blocking and Package 5.0 remains not ready.
[Acceptance record](../review/project-review-2026-09-29-p5-r5-rp11-option-1-alignment-acceptance.md).

## Decision — RP-11 recorded unadmitted pair permitted metadata-only — 2026-09-28

Peter Duscha accepts Option 1 from the RP-11 unadmitted-pair proposal. Pass A's
final state may account for exactly one unadmitted staging/final pair as two
names for one regular-file inode when both fixed names are present, the link
count is exactly two and no third name reaches the inode. The verifier compares
metadata only: it does not open, read, digest or admit either member.

Every broader or ambiguous alias state remains a fail-closed stop. This closes
`RP11-I1-R3-1` by maintainer decision. Codex's associated R2 re-review closes
`RP11-I1-R3-2` and `RP11-I1-R3-3` as remediated, with no new Blocking or
Important finding.

This decision does not accept or wire RP-11, approve a digest, authorize either
operational pass or change any package gate. RP-11 remains unmet,
`plan.is_executable=False`, P5.0-R5 remains Blocking and Package 5.0 remains
not ready.
[Decision and review record](../review/project-review-2026-09-28-p5-r5-rp11-i1-r3-r2-and-unadmitted-pair-decision.md).

## Decision — RP-11 retained-alias publication redesign accepted — 2026-09-28

Peter Duscha accepts the I1-R3 publication direction: an exclusively created
named staging inode, one descriptor-relative non-replacing hard link to the
final name, both names retained and explicitly indexed, and no automatic
unlink. The first real X-1 publication replaces the separate mutating
capability probe as the fail-closed capability test before any host command.

This authorizes preparation of a bounded repository implementation assignment,
not implementation, manifest regeneration, host work or either operational
pass. The open findings and gates remain unchanged.
[Acceptance record](../review/project-review-2026-09-28-p5-r5-rp11-i1-r3-redesign-acceptance.md).

## Decision — R-5.0-13 accepted without JNL-40(b) — 2026-09-24

Peter Duscha accepts `R-5.0-13` without requiring JNL-40(b)'s second-host or
`/etc/machine-id`-rewrite case for P5.0-R5 closure. The residual remains active
with its external-evidence controls. This resolves MD-6 only and grants no host
or execution authority.
[Decision record](../review/project-review-2026-09-24-p5-r5-md6-jnl-40b-disposition.md).

## Decision — classifier correction required before execution — 2026-09-23

Peter Duscha accepts MD-5: the journal-classifier contradictions identified in
the P5.0-R5 reconciliation must be corrected and independently reviewed before
any evidence band is treated as executable. This decision does not itself make
the plan executable or authorize implementation or host work.
[Decision record](../review/project-review-2026-09-23-p5-r5-md5-classifier-prerequisite.md).

## Decision — P5.0-R5 residual risks explicitly accepted — 2026-09-23

Peter Duscha accepts `R-5.0-10` through `R-5.0-16` as active residual risks on
the terms stated in the Phase 5.0 package plan. `R-5.0-10` and `R-5.0-11`
remain in RAID; `R-5.0-12` through `R-5.0-16` are entered. Recovery rehearsals
for `R-5.0-11`, `R-5.0-14` and `R-5.0-16` remain mandatory.

This resolves MD-4. It grants no implementation, host, reboot, deployment or
production authority and does not waive later evidence from actual production
journal code.
[Decision record](../review/project-review-2026-09-23-p5-r5-md4-residual-dispositions.md).

## Decision — supervised reboot required for P5.0-R5 feasibility closure — 2026-09-23

Peter Duscha decides that the supervised reboot durability case is mandatory
for P5.0-R5 harness-facsimile feasibility closure. It may not be recorded as
Not Run or replaced by an accepted residual at this gate. The evidence must be
produced on `oracle-test` against a harness-created disposable generation and
must show the unresolved journal state and its filesystem protections survive
and remain verifiable after reboot.

This resolves reconciliation decision **MD-3**. It creates no reboot or host
authority and does not close P5.0-R5 or make OD-62 G-A binding.
[Decision record](../review/project-review-2026-09-23-p5-r5-md3-reboot-requirement.md).

## Decision — `oracle-test` supplies P5.0-R5 feasibility host facts — 2026-09-23

Peter Duscha decides that `oracle-test`, the approved disposable target, is the
host whose facts count for P5.0-R5 harness-facsimile feasibility evidence.
Package-plan §8.1 development-host observations remain historical context and
do not satisfy target-specific feasibility requirements. Relevant facts must be
freshly observed on `oracle-test` during a separately authorized pass and bound
to its reviewed target identity and artifacts.

This resolves reconciliation decision **MD-2**. It creates no host, database or
execution authority and does not close P5.0-R5 or make OD-62 G-A binding.
[Decision record](../review/project-review-2026-09-23-p5-r5-md2-host-facts-baseline.md).

## Decision — P5.0-R5 may close on independently reviewed harness feasibility — 2026-09-23

Peter Duscha decides that P5.0-R5 may close on independently reviewed
harness-facsimile feasibility evidence from the approved disposable target.
Evidence from actual production journal code remains mandatory at the later
implementation/release gate. The records must label these evidence classes
separately; feasibility evidence is not production-code evidence.

This resolves reconciliation decision **MD-1** and breaks the circular
dependency between P5.0-R5 readiness and OD-62. It does not close P5.0-R5,
make OD-62 G-A binding, approve implementation or migration `0014`, confirm
A-5.0-5, resolve C-S4-3 or C-7, or authorize host or database action.
[Decision record](../review/project-review-2026-09-23-p5-r5-md1-evidence-criterion.md).

## Decision — four-week frozen Sheet verification window; no live mirror — 2026-09-22

Peter Duscha selects a **four-week** post-cutover verification period. At each
approved field-group cutover, the source Google Sheet is frozen read-only and
retained with its export, connector, credential and documented rollback path.
PostgreSQL is the sole authority after cutover. There are no dual writes and no
live PostgreSQL-to-Sheet diagnostic projection.

The frozen Sheet is a cutover reference and rollback implementation, not a
second authority. Rollback must use the approved reconciliation and recovery
procedure so post-cutover PostgreSQL changes are not silently discarded. Sheet
archival and credential/connector removal require successful completion of the
four-week verification gate and explicit maintainer approval under §15.1.

## Conditional direction — OD-62 G-A confirmed; binding effect remains gated — 2026-09-22

Peter Duscha confirms **G-A**, the drain-first cutover boundary, as the intended
OD-62 choice and states the operating rationale: the user base is small and the
cutover time is known and supervised. He accepts in principle G-A's residual
that a Google request accepted before the fence could be applied after the final
import without proof that it was absent.

This is not yet the binding OD-62 ruling because the existing decision gate
requires independent acceptance that P5.0-R5's enumeration control is
fail-closed. The post-cutover Sheet verification mode is also not decided.
Plan §15.1 continues to prohibit dual writes: PostgreSQL will be the sole
authority after cutover, while the Sheet and rollback path may be retained for a
numeric verification period. Any continuously updated Sheet would require a
separately reviewed, one-way PostgreSQL-to-Sheet diagnostic projection and
could not be an authority or ordinary rollback source.

## Decision — R6 findings closed as historical violations; R8 accepted; I3 closed — 2026-09-22

Peter Duscha closes **PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-1** as an accepted historical
procedural violation without retroactive compliance, and closes
**PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-2** as an accepted historical unauthorized write without
retroactive authorization. The protected `/tmp/fb-i3-r6-filelist.txt` remains
preserved; no cleanup or host access is authorized.

Peter accepts the clean R8 pass as valid replacement gate evidence and closes
**I3**. R6 remains retained as historical evidence but is inadmissible as gate
evidence. This does not change `plan.is_executable=False`, authorize
`--execute`, make Package 5.0 ready or decide OD-62.

## Decision — R8-R6 accepted; LAB-I3-R8-D1-TABLE-1 closed — 2026-09-22

Peter Duscha confirms that his direct session instruction accepted and assigned
C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R6, accepts Codex's independent review, and closes
**LAB-I3-R8-D1-TABLE-1 as remediated**. This changes no host authority,
operational evidence, I3 disposition or package gate.
[Acceptance record](../review/project-review-2026-09-22-reserved-laboratory-i3-r8-r6-acceptance.md).

## Decision — R8-R5 accepted; no R8-R2 rollback — 2026-09-22

Peter Duscha accepts Codex's independent R8-R5 review, closes
**LAB-I3-R8-R2-ROLLBACK-1 as remediated**, and decides that no R8-R2 rollback is
wanted. The corrected documentation stands; no reverse patch is to be
constructed and no file restored from `HEAD`. Both R6 Blocking findings and I3
remain open. No host authority or package advancement is created.

## Superseded pending decision — I3 disposition after R8-R5 review and the two R6 findings — 2026-09-22

*Decided above: both R6 findings are Closed by maintainer disposition and I3 is
Closed on the clean R8 replacement evidence.*

The five R8 findings disposed by Peter Duscha earlier on 2026-09-22 and
**LAB-I3-R8-R2-ROLLBACK-1**, closed after the R8-R5 review, are **Closed** and
no longer await review or decision.
**PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-1 and PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-2 remain Open, Blocking.**
I3 remains performed but unconfirmed. Its disposition follows the R8-R5 review
and explicit disposition of those two R6 findings. No host action, digest
approval or package advancement is authorized by this entry.

## Superseded pending decision — what, if anything, to roll back from C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R2 — 2026-09-22

*Decided above: no rollback is wanted and LAB-I3-R8-R2-ROLLBACK-1 is Closed.*

**LAB-I3-R8-R2-ROLLBACK-1 is Open, Important, and any rollback decision is Peter
Duscha's.** The R8-R2 handback's §8.1 offered an automated rollback —
`git checkout --` over "the eight modified documents" plus deletion of the added
handback — and claimed it would restore the exact 92-path pre-remediation state.
Both are **withdrawn** under C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R5 as unsafe and unsupported: the
nine documents R8-R2 edited all carried earlier-pass uncommitted work, **no
R8-chain content exists at `HEAD`**, two of them are untracked, and the added
handback now carries later passes' errata. The command would erase the
uncommitted R8 evidence chain rather than restore anything. **It was not
executed**, and nothing was reverted, deleted or restored.

What is for the maintainer. First, **whether any rollback of R8-R2 is wanted at
all** — its corrections are documentation and stand unless Peter decides
otherwise, and this pass proposes none. Second, **that no exact automated
rollback exists**: the pre-R8-R2 bytes are not independently available in this
repository, so reversing the R8-R2-specific hunks would require a **reviewed,
remediation-specific reverse patch or equivalent exact reconstruction preserving
every pre-existing change**, reconciled with R8-R3, R8-R4, R8-R5 and the
2026-09-22 dispositions that now build on that text, and constructed under
**maintainer coordination**, never assumed. Third, **what is not in question
here**: the closure of LAB-I3-R8-R2-ROLLBACK-1 follows Codex's re-review; no
other finding, I3, either R6 Blocking finding or any package gate is affected.

## Decision — R8-R4 accepted and five R8 findings disposed — 2026-09-22

Peter Duscha accepts Codex's independent R8-R4 review. No R8-R3 rollback is
wanted. **LAB-I3-R8-R3-ROLLBACK-1, LAB-I3-R8-R3-WORDING-1,
LAB-I3-R8-R2-GUARD-1, LAB-I3-R8-R2-COUNT-1 and LAB-I3-R8-AGGREGATE-1 are
Closed** on the terms in the linked decision record. The guard finding closes
as an accepted historical procedural violation, not as retroactive compliance;
no repeat scan is required and it does not invalidate the underlying R8
operational evidence. The aggregate finding closes with the historical R6
formula and historical cause retained as unknown and non-blocking.

**LAB-I3-R8-R2-ROLLBACK-1 remains Open, Important** under active R8-R5. Both R6
Blocking findings and I3 remain open. No host authority or package advancement
is created.

## Superseded pending decision — what, if anything, to roll back from C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R3 — 2026-09-22

*Decided above: no rollback is wanted and LAB-I3-R8-R3-ROLLBACK-1 is Closed.*

**LAB-I3-R8-R3-ROLLBACK-1 is Open, Important, and any rollback decision is Peter
Duscha's.** The R8-R3 handback's §8.1 offered an automated rollback —
`git checkout --` over ten documents plus deletion of the added handback — and
claimed it would restore the exact 93-path pre-remediation state. Both are
**withdrawn** under C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R4 as unsafe and unsupported: the ten
documents all carried earlier-pass uncommitted work, **no R8-chain content
exists at `HEAD`**, and three of the ten are untracked, so the command would
erase the uncommitted R8 evidence chain rather than restore anything. **It was
not executed**, and nothing was reverted, deleted or restored.

What is for the maintainer. First, **whether any rollback is wanted at all** —
the R8-R3 corrections are documentation and stand unless Peter decides
otherwise. Second, **that no exact automated rollback exists**: the pre-R8-R3
bytes are not independently available in this repository, so reversing the
R8-R3-specific hunks requires a **reviewed, remediation-specific reverse patch
or equivalent exact reconstruction preserving every pre-existing change**,
constructed under **maintainer coordination** and never assumed. Third, **what
is expressly not in question**: no reverse patch is proposed here, no file was
reverted, and no destructive Git command was run or is recommended.

The C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R4 remediation is documentation-only and
**repository-only**: **no command was issued to `oracle-test`**, no host
authority is created, no gate is advanced, no digest is approved and nothing is
closed. **C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R4 is consumed.**

## Superseded pending decision — disposition of the R8-R2 secrets-guard procedural violation — 2026-09-22

*Decided above: the finding is Closed as a documented and accepted historical
procedural violation, with no repeat scan and no effect on the underlying R8
operational evidence.*

**LAB-I3-R8-R2-GUARD-1 is Open, Blocking, and its disposition is Peter Duscha's
decision alone.** During C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R2, `guard-secrets.py` refused a
proposed secret-indicator scan and the operator completed substantially the same
check through a differently constructed Python scan. `.agents/AGENTS.md` states
that **a guard refusal is a stop condition, not an obstacle to route around**;
changing the command or the tool did not satisfy that rule, and completing the
refused check by another construction was a **procedural violation**.

Three points are for the maintainer rather than the operator. First, **what is
and is not evidenced**: the original call was refused, disclosure was complete,
and there is **no evidence of bypass, escalation, protected-file access or
secret disclosure**; the later scan occurred and its output **does not cure the
violation**. Second, **what the disposition covers** — whether the violation is
accepted with a recorded correction, whether any further check or disclosure is
required, and whether it bears on the R8-R2 evidence or on I3 closure at all.
Third, **what is expressly not in question**: no rule or guard change is
proposed, required or authorized, and the refused check was not rerun,
reproduced through another tool or attempted in any form under R8-R3.

The C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R3 remediation is documentation-only and **repository-only**:
**no command was issued to `oracle-test`**, no host authority is created, no
gate is advanced, no digest is approved and nothing is closed.
**C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R3 is consumed.**

## Superseded pending decision — I3 disposition on the returned R8 evidence, as corrected by R8-R1, R8-R2 and R8-R3 — 2026-09-22

*Superseded by the current I3 decision entry above. The five R8 findings this
entry described as Open are Closed by the maintainer's later disposition; its
historical evidence wording remains preserved.*

The R8 evidence now before the reviewer also includes the C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R3
correction of the R8-R2 remediation. **LAB-I3-R8-R2-GUARD-1 (Open, Blocking)**
and **LAB-I3-R8-R2-COUNT-1 (Open, Important)** join **LAB-I3-R8-AGGREGATE-1
(Open, Important)** in what independent Codex re-review must dispose of before
the I3 question is put to Peter Duscha.

One point is added to the three below. The earlier statement that the R8 §3.3
and R8-R1 candidate figures "were each correct under a different, unstated
convention" is **withdrawn**: the enumerated **960 are candidate descriptions**,
two of which reproduce `f4120970…`, while **one of the 612 distinct
calculations** does; R8 §3.3's "exactly one of 960 candidates" **mixed the units
and was wrong as written**. This changes no measured value and no conclusion
about the divergence.

*Extended 2026-09-22 under C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R4.* Two further findings join what
independent Codex re-review must dispose of before the I3 question is put to
Peter Duscha: **LAB-I3-R8-R3-ROLLBACK-1 (Open, Important)** and
**LAB-I3-R8-R3-WORDING-1 (Open, Optional)**. Both concern the R8-R3 handback's
own §8.1 — its withdrawn rollback instruction and its withdrawn "or referenced"
protected-artifact claim — and **neither bears on the measured R8 evidence, on
the aggregate divergence, or on the guard-refusal disposition**. This changes no
measured value and no conclusion about the divergence.

## Superseded pending decision — I3 disposition on the returned R8 evidence, as corrected by R8-R1 and R8-R2 — 2026-09-22

*Superseded by the entry above, which adds the two R8-R2 re-review findings and
withdraws the retroactive validation of the candidate figures. Its framing of
the aggregate question otherwise stands unaltered.*

The R8 evidence now before the reviewer includes the C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R2
correction of the R8-R1 remediation. **LAB-I3-R8-AGGREGATE-1 remains Open,
Important** and is part of what independent Codex re-review must dispose of
before the I3 question is put to Peter Duscha. The remediation is
repository-only: **no command was issued to `oracle-test`**, no host authority
is created, no gate is advanced, no digest is approved and nothing is closed.

Three points are for the maintainer rather than the operator. First, the
divergence between `4d829dc6…` and `f4120970…` is **not accounted for**; the
earlier claim that it was is **withdrawn**. What is established is that **no
byte of the measured 50-file set differs between the records**, so the
divergence cannot be explained by a change in those bytes, and that both values
reproduce from exactly those bytes under calculations differing only in ordering
key and trailing-newline rule — a demonstration that the records *can* diverge
with no byte differing. Second, **the historical cause and the calculation R6
actually performed both remain unrecorded and unresolved**, and neither is
inferred from a matching value; only a record from that pass could resolve
either. Third, whether that residual gap bears on I3 closure at all is a
maintainer judgement, not an operator one. **C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R2 is consumed.**

## Superseded pending decision — I3 disposition on the returned R8 evidence, as corrected by R8-R1 — 2026-09-21

*Superseded by the entry above, which withdraws this entry's "accounted for by
the calculation" claim. Its remaining framing stands.*

The R8 evidence now before the reviewer includes the C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R1
correction of handback §3.3. **LAB-I3-R8-AGGREGATE-1 remains Open, Important**
and is part of what independent Codex re-review must dispose of before the I3
question is put to Peter Duscha. The remediation is repository-only: **no
command was issued to `oracle-test`**, no host authority is created, no gate is
advanced, no digest is approved and nothing is closed.

Two points are for the maintainer rather than the operator. First, the
divergence between `4d829dc6…` and `f4120970…` is accounted for **by the
calculation** — both reproduce from the same unmodified local bytes under
calculations differing only in ordering key and trailing-newline rule — while
**the calculation R6 actually performed remains unrecorded and unresolved**, and
is deliberately not inferred from a matching value. Second, whether that
residual gap bears on I3 closure at all is a maintainer judgement, not an
operator one. **C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8-R1 is consumed.**

## Superseded pending decision — I3 disposition on the returned R8 evidence — 2026-09-21

*Superseded by the current I3 decision entry at the head of this register.*

The C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8 pass was performed unbroken and both invocations verified.
**Whether that evidence closes I3 is Peter Duscha's decision**, to be taken
after independent Codex technical, security and evidence review. The operator
makes no closure, approves no digest and advances no gate. **C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8 is
consumed**; any further operational pass requires fresh, explicitly bounded
authorization and assignment. PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-1 and
PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-2 remain Open, Blocking and are unaffected by this pass.

## Superseded decision — C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8 authorized and assigned to Claude — 2026-09-21

*Exercised and consumed on 2026-09-21 by the completed pass above.*


Peter Duscha authorizes C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8 for the exact accepted prompt and
assigns Claude as implementing operator. Codex remains the independent
technical, security and evidence reviewer. The authority ends after Claude's
handback, reaches nothing outside the prompt and does not close I3. Any
repository-guard or tool/harness permission denial consumes the pass without
escalation, bypass, altered re-issuance or retry.

## Superseded decision — C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8 prompt accepted; activation remains pending — 2026-09-21

Peter Duscha accepts the Codex-prepared R8 prompt. Acceptance creates no host
authority and does not assign Claude. Separate explicit authorization and
operator assignment remain pending. Codex remains the independent reviewer of
any later Claude operational handback.

## Superseded pending decision — draft C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R8 operational prompt — 2026-09-20

Peter Duscha directs preparation of a fresh I3 operational prompt for Claude.
The Codex-prepared prompt is **draft and inactive** and creates no host
authority. Activation, authorization and Claude's operator assignment remain a
later maintainer decision after Peter reviews and accepts the prompt. Codex
remains independent of Claude's operation and reviews the returned evidence. R7 remains
consumed. [Draft prompt](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-i3-r8-controlled-write-claude-prompt.md).

## Decision — C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R7 is consumed; R7-R2 review accepted — 2026-09-20

Peter Duscha accepts Codex's independent R7-R2 review and closes
PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R7-R2-1, PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R7-R1-1 and
PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R7-R1-2. He also accepts Codex's recommendation that
**C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R7 is consumed**. It cannot be resumed or retried under that
authority. Any future operational pass requires fresh, explicitly bounded
authorization and assignment, including an express rule for a harness-level
permission denial that is not a repository-guard refusal.

This decision creates no host authority and does not close I3 or either R6
Blocking finding. [Acceptance record](../review/project-review-2026-09-20-reserved-laboratory-i3-r7-r2-acceptance.md).

## Open decision — does the R7 stop consume C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R7? — restated 2026-09-20 after the R7-R2 count correction

**This decision is unchanged and still open. It is Peter Duscha's alone.** The
bounded C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R7-R2 remediation corrected one working-tree path count in
the R7-R1 handback and recorded **PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R7-R2-1** as **Open,
Important**. That is a repository bookkeeping correction. **It neither made,
narrowed nor prejudged this decision, and a path count is not an execution
digest or operational evidence.** The terms of the decision are exactly those in
the entries below, which are retained in full.

**Recorded separately — Codex's recommendation, which is still not the
decision.** Codex continues to **recommend** treating C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R7 as
consumed and requiring **fresh authority** for any future operational pass.
Under §0.3 an Independent Reviewer recommends and **Peter records the gate
decision**. The implementing operator has not converted the recommendation into
a maintainer decision or operational authority, and **no host authority exists
on its strength**.

PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R7-R1-1 and PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R7-R1-2 remain **Open,
Important** and are **not closed by the R7-R2 remediation**; their formal
disposition is Codex's. PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R7-R2-1 is likewise **Open,
Important**, closable only by independent Codex re-review. Closing any of them
is not a decision on the R7 authority. I3 remains unconfirmed;
PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-1 and PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-2 remain Open, Blocking.

## Open decision (restated 2026-09-20 after the R7-R1 remediation) — does the R7 stop consume C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R7?

**This decision is unchanged and still open. It is Peter Duscha's alone.** The
C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R7-R1 documentation remediation neither made it nor narrowed it.
Its terms are exactly those in the entry below, which is retained in full.

**Recorded separately — Codex's recommendation, which is not the decision.**
Codex's independent review of the R7 stopped-pass handback **recommends**
treating C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R7 as consumed and requiring **fresh authority** for any
future operational pass. That is a reviewer recommendation. Under §0.3 an
Independent Reviewer recommends and **Peter records the gate decision**; the
implementing operator converts the recommendation into neither a maintainer
decision nor operational authority, and has not done so. **No host authority
exists on the strength of this recommendation, and none is created by its
absence of a decision either.**

Codex's review also raised **PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R7-R1-1** (required
implementation-plan §12 context skipped on the operational pass) and
**PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R7-R1-2** (workspace identity exceeded the measured 50-file
review-input set). Both are **Open, Important**; the remediation addresses them
by erratum and reconciliation and closes neither. **Only independent Codex
re-review may close them**, and closure of a finding is not a decision on the R7
authority.

A secondary decision remains as recorded below: whether a future R7-equivalent
prompt must state in terms how an operator handles a harness-level permission
denial that is not a repository-guard refusal (RAID **LAB-I3-R7-STOP-1**).

I3 remains unconfirmed; PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-1 and PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-2
remain Open, Blocking.

## Open decision (original statement) — does the R7 stop consume C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R7? — 2026-09-20

The assigned R7 pass stopped at its first synchronization call and issued no
command to `oracle-test`. The call carried the exact accepted §3.2 command text
plus a tool-level `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` parameter the authorization never
named, and was denied before execution by the Claude Code auto-mode permission
classifier. **No repository guard refused it.** The operator stopped rather than
re-issue it, because the prompt's guard-refusal clause is ambiguous as to
harness permission denials and because PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-1 found that same
move Blocking under R6.

**The decision before Peter:** whether that stop consumes C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R7, or
whether the pass may be re-released — under this authority or a fresh one — for
a first synchronization attempt issued as the plain command with no
sandbox-bypass parameter attached. The operator makes no recommendation, closes
nothing and will issue no further host command under this authority.

A secondary decision is whether a future R7-equivalent prompt should state in
terms how an operator must handle a harness-level permission denial that is not
a repository-guard refusal (RAID **LAB-I3-R7-STOP-1**).

I3 remains unconfirmed; PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-1 and PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-2

> **Superseded as the current decision pointer by the entry above.** The

Peter Duscha accepts Codex's recommendation, authorizes one bounded R7
operational pass and assigns Claude as implementing operator. The linked prompt
is the complete authority: exact plain synchronization, read-only prerequisite
inspection, root verifier and only after complete success the `ubuntu`
verifier. Any guard refusal consumes the pass. No auxiliary host-side artifact,
manual verifier-object action or action outside the prompt is authorized.

The operator cannot close I3 or either original R6 finding. Returned evidence
requires fresh independent Codex review and Peter's later decision.
[Authorized R7 prompt](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-i3-r7-controlled-write-claude-prompt.md).

## Superseded — R6-R2 accepted; R7 authorization remains a separate decision — 2026-09-20

Peter Duscha accepts C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R6-R2 after Codex's independent review and
closes **PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-R1-1**. This accepts the corrected artifact rule
in the draft R7 prompt and creates no host authority.

The remaining immediate decision is whether to authorize
**C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R7** and explicitly assign its implementing operator. Until
that separate decision is recorded, R7 remains draft, inactive and not
authorized. The two original R6 findings remain Open, Blocking; I3 remains
unconfirmed.

## C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R6 not accepted; the I3 closure decision is not before Peter — 2026-09-20

Independent Codex review of the C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R6 pass does **not** recommend
closing I3 and raises two Blocking findings — PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-1
(execution continued after a mandatory guard stop) and PR-20260920-LAB-I3-R6-2
(unauthorized host write). Both are **Open**.

**The closure decision recorded below is therefore not ripe and is withdrawn
from Peter's queue.** The verifier runs did occur and returned internally
coherent `verified` results, but occurrence is not acceptable gate evidence: the
pass that produced them continued past a stop condition and included an
unauthorized write. I3 remains **unconfirmed and not closed**.

**The decisions now before Peter, and made by no one else, are:** whether to
accept the documentation-only C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R6-R1 remediation after independent
Codex review; how to dispose of `/tmp/fb-i3-r6-filelist.txt`, which must not be
deleted or modified in the meantime; and whether to authorize a further
operational pass. A **draft, inactive** C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R7 prompt is prepared and
is **not authorized** — it confers no permission and a new pass requires Peter's
explicit authorization and operator assignment.

C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R6 is consumed and cannot be retried under its authority. Nothing
here approves a digest, initializes V7, makes the concrete plan executable,
advances Package 5.0 or authorizes `--execute`.

Claude performed the authorized bounded operational verification as implementing
operator and returned evidence. Both invocations returned `verified`; all four
contexts published, observed and removed one object each with the
protected-hardlink filesystem-UID owner condition observed; no residue remains.

**The decision this creates is Peter's, and it is not made here:** whether the
returned evidence, after independent Codex technical, security and evidence
review, closes I3. The operator explicitly does not close it. A successful
verification approves no digest, initializes no V7, does not make the concrete
plan executable and is not authority for `--execute`. C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R6 is consumed
and cannot be reused for a further invocation.

## Superseded — C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R6 operational retry authorized — 2026-09-20

Peter Duscha authorizes C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R6 and assigns Claude as implementing
operator for the bounded I3 verification. The exact synchronization,
prerequisite checks, conditional invocation order, stop conditions, evidence
requirements and exclusions are controlled by the linked prompt. Codex remains
the Independent Reviewer and does not perform the operation. I3 remains
unconfirmed pending returned evidence and review.

## Superseded — I3 R5 reconciliation accepted; R6 authority pending — 2026-09-20

Peter Duscha accepts Codex's independent review of C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R5 with no
Blocking or Important finding. The repository reconciliation is accepted. The
prepared C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R6 prompt is not itself authority; Peter must separately
activate it and assign Claude before host action. No host action is currently
authorized.
[Acceptance](../review/project-review-2026-09-20-reserved-laboratory-i3-r5-target-identity-acceptance.md);
[draft prompt](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-i3-r6-controlled-write-retry-claude-prompt.md).

## Implemented — approved target alias and kernel nodename remain separate — 2026-09-20

The Option A decision below is **implemented in the repository** under
C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R5 and returned for independent Codex technical and security
review. `APPROVED_TARGET_FACTS.kernel_nodename` is `Test`, ordered immediately
after the unchanged `host` alias `oracle-test`, and is canonical identity
material; I3 admission compares the observed nodename with it. The
target-identity digest, confirmation token, manifest version (16 → 17) and
review-input digest moved as the decision required, and the previously accepted
`be9e110f…` is not evidence for the reconciled tree. Implementation closes no
review finding, approves no digest and authorizes no host action or I3 retry.
[Handback](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-i3-r5-target-identity-handback.md).

## Decided — approved target alias and kernel nodename remain separate — 2026-09-20

Peter Duscha chooses **Option A**. `host` remains `oracle-test`, the operational
SSH alias. A separately named approved nodename fact is `Test`, and I3 admission
must compare the value observed through `os.uname().nodename` with that fact.
The alias and nodename must not be collapsed into one field.

This closes LAB-I3-TARGET-1 as a decision blocker and authorizes the bounded
repository-only C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R5 reconciliation. Because nodename becomes
canonical target-identity material, the target-identity digest, confirmation
token, manifest and review-input digest must change and receive fresh
independent review. No host action or I3 retry is authorized.
[Decision](../review/project-review-2026-09-20-reserved-laboratory-i3-target-identity-decision.md).

## Superseded — open decision required: the approved target's identity — 2026-09-20

**Raised by the refused C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R4 pass; no decision is made here.** The
I3 verifier's admission compares `os.uname()`'s nodename against
`APPROVED_TARGET_FACTS.host`. The target's nodename is `Test`; the recorded
fact is `oracle-test`, the SSH alias. The root invocation refused with
`target-mismatch` before any controlled write, so I3 could not be verified: no
verifier-controlled mutation occurred, the verifier having created no verifier
object. The pass's two disclosed effects on the target — the authorized
synchronization of the repository worktree, and the operator's capture files
`/tmp/fb-i3-root.out` and `/tmp/fb-i3-root.err`, which are evidence artifacts
outside canonical `R` and the four publication directories, not verifier
residue — bear on neither this decision nor the refusal. (Wording per
correction C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R4-E1, which changes no result and authorizes no host
action.)

The decision belongs to the maintainer because `host` is hashed into
`TARGET_IDENTITY_DIGEST`, the review manifest and `CONFIRMATION_TOKEN`: any
resolution moves the accepted review-input digest `be9e110f…` and requires
fresh independent review before an operational retry. The three options —
record a separate nodename fact and compare that; make `host` the nodename
`Test` and keep the alias in the runbook only; or set the target's nodename to
`oracle-test` — are stated unchosen in the handback §10. RAID LAB-I3-TARGET-1.
[Handback](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-i3-r4-controlled-write-blocker-handback.md).

## I3 R3 repository reconciliation accepted — 2026-09-20

Peter Duscha accepts Codex's independent technical and security review of
C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R3 with no finding. The two mode discrepancies are closed at the
repository level. This acceptance does not confirm I3 or authorize host action.

The single next step is a fresh bounded operational authorization for Claude to
run the separately armed I3 verifier on `oracle-test`, root invocation then
`ubuntu` invocation, against the accepted manifest-version-16 tree, and return
evidence for independent Codex review. The superseded 2026-09-19 authorization
is consumed. [Acceptance](../review/project-review-2026-09-20-reserved-laboratory-i3-r3-mode-reconciliation-acceptance.md).

## Superseded — the two mode rulings implemented; review pending — 2026-09-20

C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R3 implements both rulings in one bounded repository-only pass
and returns for fresh independent Codex technical and security review. No
decision was made or reopened by the implementer: the owner-condition ruling,
capability evidence contract, verifier topology, publication primitive and
P2's final mode are untouched.

No new decision is required by the implementation. The open decision is the
maintainer's, on the returned evidence: whether to accept C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R3.
Until that review is accepted, no operational I3 invocation is authorized.
[Handback](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-i3-r3-mode-reconciliation-handback.md).

## Superseded — I3 R2 accepted; `R` and P2 temporary modes decided — 2026-09-20

Peter Duscha accepts Codex's independent C-P5.0-LAB-I3-R2 technical and
security review with no Blocking or Important finding. The bounded repository
implementation is accepted; this does not confirm I3 or authorize an
operational invocation.

Peter resolves the reported discrepancies in favour of r6. Canonical `R` is
created as `0700`. P2 alone creates its temporary as `0500`, using the already
open writable descriptor to write and synchronize it and applying final `0555`
before publication. An explicit creation-mode parameter retains `0600` as the
default for T1, T6 and §2.3.3.

One bounded repository-only reconciliation and fresh independent Codex review
must precede any operational I3 authorization. [Decision and accepted
review](../review/project-review-2026-09-20-reserved-laboratory-i3-r2-acceptance-and-discrepancy-ruling.md).

## P2 protected-hardlink condition and I3 verifier topology decided — 2026-09-19

Peter Duscha rules that P2 installs `root:root 0555` and relies on the
protected-hardlink filesystem-UID owner condition. The former P2
`CAP_FOWNER` dependency is withdrawn. The implementation must observe the
actual operation-time capability masks and must not equate `CapBnd` with
`CapEff` or claim to isolate `CAP_FOWNER`.

Decision B is narrowly amended: the separately armed I3 verifier may
temporarily create canonical `/var/lib/fb-evidence-p5-0` (`R`) and `R/bin`
solely for I3, using reviewed ownership/modes and identity-guarded cleanup.
Mismatch, residue or cleanup/barrier failure is non-success. This is not
prerequisite provisioning and does not authorize a general second creator.

The ruling authorizes no host action. A bounded repository remediation and
fresh independent Codex technical/security review must precede any operational
release. [Independent review](../review/project-review-2026-09-19-reserved-laboratory-i3-r1-decision-handback.md).

## Superseded — bounded I3 controlled-write verification authorized — 2026-09-19

Peter Duscha authorizes one controlled I3 verification using the reviewed
`linkat`/`unlinkat` sequence in the exact target filesystem. Create only the
uniquely named temporary test object and its hard link; verify byte equality
and shared `(st_dev, st_ino)`; remove both names; synchronize the containing
directory; and prove no residue remains. Stop on any discrepancy or cleanup
failure. Do not initialize V7, invoke a participant or harness, access the
database, run a generated vector, or use `--execute`. Return complete evidence
for independent review. Success confirms I3 only and does not make the plan
executable or advance Package 5.0.

Peter subsequently assigns Claude as implementing operator through the bounded
[operator prompt](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-i3-controlled-write-claude-prompt.md).
Codex remains the Independent Reviewer. Claude must stop before the first write
if the complete I3 scope, exact target or already reviewed operator route is
absent or ambiguous.

That assignment stopped before implementation. Its unresolved P2
`CAP_FOWNER` premise and topology restriction are superseded by the ruling
above; its operational authority is consumed and no host action is released.

## LAB-SECRETS-1 recorded as separate defensive-tooling issue — 2026-09-19

Peter Duscha accepts the recommendation to record **LAB-SECRETS-1, Open,
Low**: the name-based secrets guard does not detect every indirect reference,
including shell globs that resolve to secret filenames and broad directory
copies containing secret files. The governing prohibition in
`.agents/AGENTS.md` remains fully applicable; the hook is defense in depth, not
an authorization boundary. Remediation requires a separately reviewed
fail-closed design that does not expand or read secret paths while inspecting a
proposed command. This issue does not reopen LAB-V6-P3, invalidate
C-P5.0-LAB-V6-P-R4, or block Package 5.0.

## R4 one-time synchronization deviation accepted — 2026-09-19

Peter Duscha accepts the explicitly authorized, one-time `--exclude-from`
synchronization deviation used during C-P5.0-LAB-V6-P-R4. The supplied rules
were identical to the runbook exclusions, the maintainer performed the final
synchronization, no secret-type file appeared in the transfer evidence, and
the target matched all 45 reviewed source digests. This acceptance is
retrospective and pass-specific; it does not authorize `--exclude-from` for
future synchronization, which must use the accepted inline runbook command.
[Independent review](../review/project-review-2026-09-19-r4-synchronization-deviation.md).

## I12/V6 evidence accepted; V6 closed — 2026-09-19

Peter Duscha accepts the independent review of the I12/V6 evidence and closes
V6. Closure confirms only the approved read-only prerequisite survey. I3
remains unconfirmed and requires separate authorization; V7 remains excluded,
V8 and V10 remain unperformed, `plan.is_executable` remains false, and Package
5.0 remains not ready. Acceptance of the one-pass `--exclude-from`
synchronization deviation remains a separate pending decision. [Independent
review](../review/project-review-2026-09-19-reserved-laboratory-i12-v6-closure.md).

## LAB-V6-P3 guard remediation accepted and issue closed — 2026-09-19

Peter Duscha accepts the independent Codex technical and security review of
the LAB-V6-P3 remediation r1 with no Blocking or Important finding. Peter's
in-session instruction of 2026-09-19 is recorded as the authorization for the
repository-only remediation. **LAB-V6-P3 is Closed.** The separate question of
whether the name-based guard's pre-existing glob/directory-copy limitation
needs its own RAID item remains pending. This decision does not close V6 or
accept the earlier `--exclude-from` synchronization deviation. [Independent
review](../review/project-review-2026-09-19-lab-v6-p3-secrets-guard-remediation.md).

## Superseded — LAB-V6-P3 guard remediation returned for review — 2026-09-19

On 2026-09-19 Peter Duscha instructed Claude in session to correct the LAB-V6-P3 secrets-guard remediation and submit it for independent Codex review. The first draft (2026-09-18) had no recorded assignment and exempted double-quoted `--exclude` values, which let command substitution read a secret; r1 exempts only single-quoted values inside one plain `rsync` invocation. The authorization, acceptance and LAB-V6-P3 disposition questions are resolved by the decision above; the separate glob/directory limitation question remains pending. The C-P5.0-LAB-V6-P-R4 decisions below remain pending. [Handback](../review/phase-5-0-lab-v6-p3-secrets-guard-remediation-handback.md).

## C-P5.0-LAB-V6-P-R4 applied; decisions pending — 2026-09-18

Claude returns the operational handback. V6, LAB-V6-P3 and the one-pass `--exclude-from` synchronization deviation were subsequently accepted by the 2026-09-19 decisions above. The deviation acceptance is retrospective and pass-specific and does not authorize future `--exclude-from` use. [Handback](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-v6-p-r4-operational-provisioning-handback.md).

## Superseded — exact-detail admission accepted; operational retry released — 2026-09-18

Peter accepts Codex's independent review of C-P5.0-LAB-V6-P-R3 with no finding,
closes **PR-20260918-LAB-V6P-R2-1** and **LAB-V6-P1**, and authorizes
**C-P5.0-LAB-V6-P-R4**. Claude is the implementing operator for safe
synchronization and inspection on `oracle-test`, application of V1, V2, V3,
V12, V4, V9 and V5 in that order, and only the subsequent read-only I12/V6
verification. Codex remains the Independent Reviewer.

The review-input digest is reproducible but remains unapproved for execution.
V7, I3, V8, V10, database access, participants, generated-vector execution,
the evidence harness, a real boundary/materializer and `--execute` remain
unauthorized. LAB-V6-P2 is deferred and Package 5.0 remains not ready.

## Superseded — missing provisioning entry point authorized for implementation — 2026-09-18

Peter accepts Codex's independent review of the C-P5.0-LAB-V6-P blocker. There
is no approved existing operator invocation to name, so the resolved direction
is **C-P5.0-LAB-V6-P-R1**: Claude is authorized to add one bounded, dedicated,
explicitly armed repository CLI that constructs `SystemIdentityLookup`, invokes
the reviewed `DirectoryProvisioner` with the production `directory_targets()`
values and safely renders the complete `ProvisioningRun`.

This is a repository-local implementation decision, not a new architecture,
topology or product-policy choice. Independent Codex technical and security
review is mandatory before use. No SSH, synchronization, target inspection or
mutation is authorized; the later operational retry requires separate Peter
release. LAB-V6-P1 remains Open pending accepted implementation; LAB-V6-P2 is
deferred; no digest or gate is approved.

## Prerequisite provisioning returned unapplied; maintainer direction required — 2026-09-17

Claude, as the assigned implementing operator under **C-P5.0-LAB-V6-P**,
stopped before the first mutation and returned the
[handback](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-v6-p-provisioning-blocker-handback.md)
for independent Codex technical and security review. **Nothing was applied to
`oracle-test`.**

The decision the maintainer now owns is **how the four directory items are to
be reached**, because the repository has no already reviewed operator
invocation that can drive the provisioner as approved (**LAB-V6-P1**). The two
readings this pass can see are to authorize a bounded implementation pass that
adds the missing invocation and returns it for independent review before it
applies anything, or to rule that an existing route is the approved one and
name it. **Claude takes neither.**

A second, minor disposition is open: the secrets guard refuses documentation
prose that its own contract permits (**LAB-V6-P2**).

This closes no finding, approves no digest and advances no gate. V6 remains
performed-but-not-closed, I3 unconfirmed, V7 excluded, V8, V10 and I12
unperformed, `is_executable=False`, and Package 5.0 not ready.

## Reviewed prerequisite provisioning released — 2026-09-17

Peter assigns **Claude as implementing operator** to apply on `oracle-test` the
reviewed subset **V1, V2, V3, V12, V4, V9 and V5, in that order**, followed
only by the read-only I12/V6 verification. Necessary safe synchronization,
inspection and administrative operations for those items are authorized.
**Codex remains the Independent Reviewer and does not perform the operation.**

V7, the I3 controlled-write test, participant wiring, database access,
generated-vector execution, a real participant, the evidence harness, a real
boundary/materializer and `--execute` remain unauthorized. Stop after the
evidence handback for independent Codex review.

## V6-D-R1 correction review accepted — 2026-09-17

Peter accepts Codex's independent technical and security
[re-review](../review/project-review-2026-09-17-reserved-laboratory-v6-d-r1-contract-correction.md)
with no finding and closes **PR-20260917-LAB-V6D-R1-1**. D1 is confirmed as
the descriptor for canonical `R`'s parent `/var/lib`; no intermediate
provisioned evidence directory exists in the accepted topology.

This is acceptance of the documentation correction only. It approves no
digest, authorizes no provisioning or execution, and advances no gate. V6
remains performed-but-not-closed, I3 unconfirmed, V7 excluded,
`is_executable=False`, and Package 5.0 not ready.

## V6 R4 accepted and provisioning topology decided — 2026-09-17

Peter accepts the independent R4 review and closes PR-20260916-LAB-V6R3-1.
The unreproducible R3 digest `5602eb95…` is not approved; the reproducible R4
artifact supersedes it as review input only.

V11 and `/opt/freedom-blades/evidence` are withdrawn, with no ownership change
to `/opt/freedom-blades`. `/var/lib/fb-evidence-p5-0` is the sole canonical
value of `R`. V12 explicitly provisions `/var/lib/freedom-blades` as persistent
`root:root 0755` before V4 and V5. `EVIDENCE_ROLE` remains unregistered until a
separately reviewed real production participant consumes it.

This authorizes one repository-local remediation and its review, not host
access or application. V7 remains excluded, I3 unconfirmed and `--execute`
unauthorized.

## V6 prerequisite-survey boundary approved — 2026-09-15

Peter approves the V6 re-scope recommended by Codex: the authorized read-only
preflight may observe filesystem/mount type, `fs.protected_hardlinks`, execution
identity, ownership/mode assumptions and relevant capability state. This is a
prerequisite survey, not proof that `linkat` succeeds, and it does not close I3.
A controlled write verification requires separate authorization before
execution.

The preflight remains queued behind remediation and independent re-review of
PR-20260915-LAB-D12-1. No provisioning, permission change, database operation,
participant wiring, generated-vector execution, real execution or `--execute`
is authorized.

## Historical — D1/D2 and scoped trust model approved; read-only preflight authorized — 2026-09-15

Peter accepts the scoped same-process trusted-operator model and approves both
D1 and D2 for runner contract r6. D1 adopts the fail-closed
`linkat`/`unlinkat` exclusive-publication substitute; D2 adds D20, the
short-lived traversal-anchored listing descriptor. Peter also authorizes the
documented read-only target preflight, which remains queued behind independent
review of the contract edit.

No provisioning, permission change, database operation, generated-vector
execution, participant wiring, real execution or `--execute` is authorized.
C-7, EH-R16-1, P5.0-R5, OD-62 and LAB-R6 retain their states.

## Historical — reserved-laboratory one-shot authority re-review accepted — 2026-09-15

Codex's independent
[re-review](../review/project-review-2026-09-15-reserved-laboratory-one-shot-authority.md)
closes PR-20260914-LABI-R2-1 within its stated trust boundary. **No product,
architecture, operational or gate decision is taken.** A process boundary for
adversarial same-interpreter code would be a new architecture decision and is
not inferred from this acceptance.

D1 and D2 remain proposed; r6 remains unedited; V6 and all target facts remain
unconfirmed; LAB-R6, C-7, EH-R16-1, P5.0-R5 and OD-62 retain their states. The
next action is maintainer direction.

## Historical — reserved-laboratory one-shot authority remediation assigned — 2026-09-15

Peter assigns **C-P5.0-LAB-I-R2** through the bounded
[Claude prompt](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-live-authority-r2-claude-prompt.md)
to remediate PR-20260914-LABI-R2-1. **No product, architecture, operational or
gate decision is taken.** This is a correction within the already authorized
repository-local reservation mechanism: one durable start must authorize no
more than one reviewed execution.

D1 and D2 remain proposed and unapproved; r6 remains unedited; V6 and all other
target facts remain unconfirmed; the six non-harness wrappers remain unwired
under LAB-R6; and C-7, EH-R16-1, P5.0-R5 and OD-62 retain their states. The
implementer returns a handback for independent review and approves nothing.

## Historical — reserved-laboratory call-graph remediation returned — 2026-09-14

The remediation of Codex re-review finding PR-20260914-LABI-R1-1 is
[returned](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-call-graph-remediation-handback.md)
for independent Codex technical and security re-review. **No decision is taken
by it.**

1. **D1 and D2** remain open and unchanged. The re-review said the proposed
   amendment can be read once the Blocking call-graph defect is remediated; it
   is unedited, **r6 is unedited**, and **V6 remains unconfirmed**.
2. **The six non-harness wrappers — LAB-R6.** The re-review agreed with the
   previous handback that this must not be closed here and needs a separately
   authorized, ordered provisioning-and-wiring rollout. It is unchanged, and it
   is the first question in the new handback.
3. **One new matter is put to the maintainer.** r6 §5.7's **T7** and **T8** —
   the reservation record's own `admitted` and `running` entries — are published
   by `ParticipantIntegration.run_harness` in this pass, because
   `conclude_reservation` refuses a release of a reservation the stored history
   never admitted, so without them §5.12 has **no reachable successful path**.
   The r6 table names the executor as their actor, which is the reading taken.
   If the intent is instead that an operator grants the reservation out of band
   before the harness runs, that is a different owner for two durable writes and
   is a maintainer's ruling, not an implementer's inference.
4. **A related, smaller matter.** `--reservation-owner`, `--requested-at`,
   `--deadline` and `--recovery-owner` are the minimum `ReservationRequest`
   refuses to be constructed without, and they are command-line options in this
   pass. Whether the reservation should instead be read from the durable record
   or from a reservation file is a decision about where a reservation lives, and
   it is raised rather than taken.

**No authority, scope, privacy, architecture, data-ownership or gate decision
changes.** C-7 remains unresolved; EH-R16-1 Open; the twelve target facts
unconfirmed; `is_executable` False; Package 5.0 not ready; P5.0-R5 Blocking; and
OD-62 Open.

## Reserved-laboratory remediation returned — 2026-09-14

The C-P5.0-LAB-I-R1 remediation is
[returned](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-implementation-remediation-handback.md)
for independent Codex technical and security re-review. **No decision is taken
by it.** The 2026-09-13 register put three matters to the reviewer; their state
is now:

1. **D1 — `linkat` + `unlinkat` for `renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE)`:** still
   open, and now written as an exact
   [proposed r6 amendment](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-r6-d1-d2-proposed-amendment.md)
   naming the two-syscall, two-name interruption state and the preserved
   temporary. **r6 is unedited.** The proposal narrows V6's scope without
   closing it; **V6 remains unconfirmed**.
2. **D2 — the listing descriptor:** still open, and written as the same
   document's proposed **D20** row and §1.3.2 addition. Reported as a gap in an
   accepted contract, not treated as authorized.
3. **The `install`/`chattr` scope boundary:** **taken inside this pass**, as the
   prompt directed. `plan.PERMITTED_EXECUTABLES` is **20**, the generator emits
   descriptor-bound effects for all 35 affected steps, and neither executable is
   reachable from any string literal in the package. It is implementation, not a
   decision to ratify; the reviewer is asked in the handback whether keeping
   `rm` and `rmdir` as command steps is the reading r6 §6.4 intends.

**One new matter is put to the reviewer:** whether wiring the six non-harness
participants to their integration points should be a follow-up authorization, or
should wait until the r6 §7 delta is provisioned — since an integration point
refuses on an absent lock, and wiring it on an unprovisioned host would stop
every suite. It is carried as RAID item **LAB-R6**.

Target preflight, applied provisioning and execution each remain separate future
decisions. C-7 and EH-R16-1 stay open; P5.0-R5 and OD-62 retain their states;
`is_executable` remains `False`; the shared `ubuntu` identity choice is
unchanged and its target fact **V10** remains unconfirmed.

## Reserved-laboratory implementation returned — 2026-09-13

The C-P5.0-LAB-I implementation is
[returned](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-implementation-handback.md)
for independent Codex technical and security review. **No decision is taken by
it.** Three matters are put to the reviewer rather than decided by the
implementer:

1. whether `linkat` + `unlinkat` is an acceptable substitute for
   `renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE)`, which Python 3.12's `os` does not expose and
   which the repository's one `ctypes` exception does not cover. If accepted,
   preflight item **V6** ceases to be a prerequisite of the publication path;
2. whether the short-lived `.`-relative listing descriptor is the right answer
   to r6 §1.3.3 enumerating no descriptor for the `readdir` that §§2.5 and 5.11
   require — a gap in an accepted contract, reported rather than resolved; and
3. whether deferring the plan generator's migration off `/usr/bin/install` and
   `/usr/bin/chattr` is the right scope boundary, leaving
   `PERMITTED_EXECUTABLES` at 22 rather than r6 §6.4's 20.

Target preflight, applied provisioning and execution each remain separate future
decisions. C-7 and EH-R16-1 stay open; P5.0-R5 and OD-62 retain their states;
`is_executable` remains `False`; the shared `ubuntu` identity choice is
unchanged and its target fact **V10** remains unconfirmed.

## Reserved-laboratory implementation authorization — 2026-09-13

Peter authorizes **C-P5.0-LAB-I**: repository implementation and local tests for
the accepted r6 mechanism and the bounded code required to address C-7 and
EH-R16-1. This is not a new design choice: it implements the already selected
shared `ubuntu` identity and ten-item design basis.

No operational decision is made. Target preflight, applied provisioning and
execution each remain separate future decisions. C-7 and EH-R16-1 stay open
until independent review; P5.0-R5 and OD-62 retain their states.

## LAB-1 disposition recorded — 2026-09-13

Codex's independent [R3 re-review](../review/project-review-2026-09-13-lab1-rereview-r3.md)
accepts the bounded raw-byte remediation with no residual finding. LAB-1's
Important classification was confirmed earlier and its local remediation is now
closed. The earlier D-LAB-1 criterion-split proposal was withdrawn after the
corrected ordering established that the two absence clauses were observable; it
is not an open decision and no criterion was changed.

This resolves no operational decision. Peter's accepted ten-item design basis
is not provisioned or authorized for execution; C-7, EH-R16-1, the twelve target
facts, P5.0-R5 and OD-62 retain their recorded states.

## Historical proposal — criterion split for `JNL-47-RECOVERY-STATE`, 2026-09-11

**D-LAB-1. Open. Not decided, not assumed, and not pre-approved by the laboratory
direction.** Claude's [handback](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-handback.md) §3.4
submits the exact readiness-versus-implementation split for the one C-7 case that
cannot be meaningful without gated product code:

* **Option A (recommended)** — clauses 1–5 (exit status, §2.13.2b state, safe
  residue path reporting, next-run refusal, named operator recovery) stay a
  **readiness** criterion under P5.0-R5; clauses 6–7 (generation absence,
  database-row absence) become an **implementation acceptance** criterion at the
  Package 5.0 gate, because they are only observable once a coordinator can
  create a generation to be absent.
* **Option B** — no split. P5.0-R5 then cannot close before Package 5.0
  implementation, and implementation cannot start before P5.0-R5 closes. The
  circularity is stated rather than worked around.

Neither option reduces a requirement. Codex reviews the split; Peter decides in
the Acceptance Authority role. Until then the case stays declared unresolved and
the requirement stays in force in full.

**LAB-1's severity classification** is also outstanding and belongs to Codex.
Claude proposes Important and does not classify its own finding.

## Reserved laboratory remediation returned — C-P5.0-LAB-1, 2026-09-11

The bounded local remediation is complete and returned for technical review. It
decided nothing: no OD moved, no residual was accepted, no finding was closed and
no criterion was changed. The permission delta is zero and the EH-R16-1 remedy is
submitted rather than built. VM-D1/2/3 and ADR 0011 remain deferred and Proposed.

## Current laboratory direction — C-P5.0-LAB-1, 2026-09-10

Peter authorized proceeding with the [reserved disposable laboratory direction](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-direction.md)
and bounded local remediation following Codex's repercussions assessment. Host
administrators are trusted; unrelated work is excluded during the reservation;
experimental adversaries retain their explicitly tested powers. This is not a
claim that a host lock constrains root or that reservation is already enforced.

VM-D1/2/3 and ADR 0011 are deferred from the current Package 5.0 work, not accepted
or closed. Their historical review remains below. Next action is the
[Claude remediation prompt](../review/phase-5-0-reserved-laboratory-claude-prompt.md).
No new host inspection, privileged interface or execution digest is approved.
The three missing producer dispositions must distinguish feasibility from future
product evidence; any necessary readiness criterion split requires a concrete
maintainer decision. Production OD decisions and open package gates are unchanged.

## Proposed evidence-harness decisions — 2026-09-10

The maintainer authorized preparation of the VM alternative and requested the
explicit Claude review handover. **Only preparation and independent design
review are authorized.** [ADR 0011](../adr/0011-disposable-vm-evidence-boundary.md)
and [design §11](../review/phase-5-0-evidence-vm-design.md) await Claude's
recommendation. These local proposal IDs do not renumber existing OD decisions.

| Proposal | State / decision owner | Required before |
|---|---|---|
| VM-D1 — whole-guest outer harness ownership/cleanup contract | Proposed, unaccepted / Peter, after Claude review | Implementing the alternative; does not replace production recovery evidence |
| VM-D2 — management surface, candidate host and exact feasibility scope | Proposed, unaccepted / Peter as Operations Owner | New host inspection, provisioning, image build or VM creation; none performed |
| VM-D3 — external trust boundary, capacity and retention limits | Proposed, unaccepted / Peter with independent security recommendation | Baseline and execution approval |

Claude's prompt is [Handover information](../review/Handover%20information).
No proposal accepts a residual, closes EH-R16-1 or changes OD-62's Open state.
Package 5.0 remains not ready. Existing decisions below remain binding.

**Review returned 2026-09-10 — changes requested; nothing decided.**
[`VM evidence boundary independent review`](../review/phase-5-0-evidence-vm-independent-review.md)
recommends **deferring VM-D1**, narrowing any VM-D2 authorization to a read-only
host inspection whose first question is whether a sole-controller host exists, and
holding **VM-D3 not ready to decide** until VM-1, VM-2, VM-3 and VM-6 are corrected.
It also raises one new item for Codex technical acceptance: an unconditional
executor refusal keyed to EH-R16-1 rather than to target facts (VM-5).
The review decides nothing and accepts no residual on Peter's behalf; ADR 0011
remains **Proposed**.

**Current decision update, 2026-09-02.** Peter Duscha approved **D5.0-11 /
OD-64 Option A**, **D5.0-12 / OD-65 Option B**, and **D5.0-13 / OD-66 Option
A / J-1** in all accountable roles. The dedicated coordinator boundary, the
isolated Sheet-writer and provenance controls (with correction of the
group-writable worktree deferred to a separate maintenance change), and the
full durable sealed/registered journal contract are now binding Package 5.0
inputs. OD-66's approval does not by itself accept R-5.0-12 through R-5.0-16;
their explicit dispositions and the operational evidence remain outstanding.
Peter recorded **G-A as the provisional direction for D5.0-9 / OD-62**, but
expressly deferred its binding ruling until P5.0-R5's operational evidence and
independent review are complete. OD-62 therefore remains Open. Package 5.0
remains `not ready`, and implementation remains unauthorized.

**Security-review dependency update, 2026-09-02.** Codex delivered the
revision-12 Security Reviewer recommendation and closed P5.0-SR1/SR2 on design.
D5.0-11 / OD-64, D5.0-12 / OD-65 and D5.0-13 / OD-66 are now rulable by their
accountable owners; none is ruled by the review. D5.0-9 / OD-62 remains last.
Operational evidence and P5.0-R5 still block readiness and implementation.

**Current decision update, 2026-09-02.** Peter Duscha accepted Codex's closure
recommendation for P4-PG4 and P4-PG5; Phase 4 remains approved and closed.
Peter also approved **D5.0-10 / OD-63 Option 1** in every accountable role. The
nine numeric controls are accepted, with N5.0-18 fixed at **120 seconds — an
operational margin, not a barrier**. The older open D5.0-10 row below is
superseded by this decision and retained as decision history. D5.0-11 through
D5.0-13 were subsequently approved as recorded in the current update above;
D5.0-9 remains Open. Package 5.0 remains `not ready`.

**Phase 4 post-gate correction note, 2026-08-31. No decision is required or
made.** P4-PG1 through P4-PG3 are Closed; P4-PG4 and P4-PG5 have a bounded
implementation remediation and Codex re-review before Phase 5 preparation
resumes. The correction changes no architecture, authority, schema, migration,
deployment, data ownership, phase order or release boundary. D5.0-9 through
D5.0-13 / OD-62 through OD-66 remain Open and unchanged.

**Superseded as the active work item — Security remediation R11 submitted,
2026-08-31. No decision is made by it.**

The Package 5.0 security review returned **P5.0-SR1 (Blocking)** and **P5.0-SR2
(Important)** with no readiness recommendation; revision 12 of the package plan
and the logical schema remediates both and **claims neither closed**.
**D5.0-9 through D5.0-13 / OD-62 through OD-66 remain Open and must not be ruled
from revision 12.** No decision number is added and **no option is adopted**.

Two decision entries change **content**, and neither changes state:

- **D5.0-12 / OD-65's scope is extended** by the reviewed-source provenance
  objects — a `root:root 0700` bare Git object store, an out-of-band
  approved-revision record and a per-component provenance record, all three new
  host objects, one of them a governance artifact needing a custody procedure —
  and by the **canonical identity and group membership table** provisioning must
  create in a stated order and re-verify after any account, group or deployment
  change. Its option set grows from three to four: **option C** now names taking
  everything *except* the provenance objects, and the implementer's assessment,
  recorded so it can be disagreed with, is that **option C leaves P5.0-SR1
  unremediated**.
- **D5.0-13 / OD-66 gains option A-3**, a cryptographically signed
  approved-revision record verified against a root-held keyring, which would
  narrow residual **R-5.0-15** to its A5-only case. **It is priced and
  deliberately not adopted**, on the same reasoning as option A-2: a signing key
  is a governance change with its own custody, rotation, revocation and
  availability failure modes, and it is the Acceptance Authority's to make.
  Option A's **cost** also grows by a seventh table, four columns and three
  fail-closed conditions.

**Everything else holds.** Options A, A-2, B, C and D of OD-66 are unchanged word
for word; no numeric control is added or moved; no vocabulary widens except the
new closed two-value `component`; and no schema object is *adopted* — the seventh
table and the four columns are **proposed**, like every object in the logical
schema, and remain so until the schema gate closes. Package 5.0 remains `not
ready` and implementation remains unauthorized.

**Superseded — Security Reviewer named, 2026-08-31.** Peter Duscha named **Codex** the
Package 5.0 Security Reviewer, closing **D5.0-8 / OD-61**. **This is the only
decision closed by it.** D5.0-9 through D5.0-13 / OD-62 through OD-66 remain
**Open**; no option is adopted; no finding closes; A-5.0-3, A-5.0-4 and A-5.0-5
remain unconfirmed. Package 5.0 remains `not ready` and implementation remains
unauthorized. **D5.0-11, D5.0-12 and D5.0-13 are owned *on the Security
Reviewer's review* and stay unrulable until that recommendation exists;
D5.0-10 carries no such dependency and is rulable now** — its unsigned
change-control package is `docs/review/phase-5-0-od-63-ruling-draft.md`.
**D5.0-9 is ruled last**, being the risk acceptance the other four price.

**Superseded on the reviewer-naming point — revision 11 independent re-review, 2026-08-31.** R10-A through R10-C are
materially addressed on paper, with no new Blocking or Important design
finding. This review decides nothing: D5.0-9 through D5.0-13 / OD-62 through
OD-66 remain **Open**, no option is adopted, and the Security Reviewer remains
unnamed. Package 5.0 remains `not ready` and implementation remains
unauthorized. The active handover routes these decisions to their accountable
owners before any implementation brief may be issued.

**Superseded — remediation R10 submitted, 2026-08-31.** D5.0-9 / OD-62 through D5.0-13 /
OD-66 remain **Open** and **must not be ruled from revision 11**. Revision 11 of
the package plan and the logical schema is **documentation and design only**, it
**claims no finding closed**, and it **raises no new decision number and no new
option**. **No option, risk, decision or schema object is adopted or closed by
R10.**

**D5.0-13 / OD-66's options do not move at all.** R10 corrects how the *evidence
harness* constructs the identities that test option A's threat model — a
`capsh(1)` launch procedure replacing `setpriv` recipes the named tool rejects —
and touches no artifact, authority, column, refusal code, retention rule or cost
of option A. **Option A-2** (an independent authenticated host-bound value)
remains unchanged and **not adopted**; options **B**, **C** and **D** are
unchanged.

**The `capsh` choice is not a decision this register records, and is deliberately
not raised as one.** It is an evidence-harness mechanism inside assumption
**A-5.0-5**, which is unconfirmed: it installs nothing, sets no file capability,
creates no set-user-ID artifact, adds no `sudoers` rule, unit, group, account or
directory beyond the disposable `fbprobe` identity revision 10 already carried,
and changes no production tool — `verify-capability`, `freedom-journal-admin`,
`migration-authority` and the writer are untouched. It is routed to the
**Security Reviewer** in package plan §9.2 as a question, with the declined
alternatives named. **If the Acceptance Authority judges that an evidence
mechanism belongs in this register, that is a ruling to make rather than one this
submission has made.**

**Nothing else that feeds a ruling has moved.** The threat model stays at eleven
authorities and thirteen falsification rows; the evidence band stays at fifty
identifiers and eighty-eight cases; the Security Reviewer's estimate stays at
**3.5–4.5** reviewer-days; the PERT estimate stays at **40.9**; and assumption
**A-5.0-5** is widened to name the new mechanism and its prerequisites and
**remains unconfirmed**. The Security Reviewer remains **unnamed**; Package 5.0
remains `not ready`; implementation is **unauthorized**; and **an independent
re-review of revision 11 is required**.

**Superseded — revision-10 independent re-review, 2026-08-31.** D5.0-9 / OD-62 through
D5.0-13 / OD-66 remain **Open** and must not be ruled from revision 10. The
review requests remediation R10 solely because the documented E-identity launch
recipes and declared capability masks do not agree with the named `setpriv`
contract. It adds no decision, option, artifact, authority, column, refusal code
or accepted cost. Option A and option A-2 remain unchanged and unadopted; the
Security Reviewer remains unnamed; Package 5.0 remains `not ready`; implementation
is unauthorized.

**Superseded — remediation R9 submitted, 2026-08-30.** D5.0-9 / OD-62 through D5.0-13 / OD-66
remain **Open** and **must not be ruled from revision 10**. Revision 10 of the
package plan and the logical schema is **documentation and design only**, it
**claims no finding closed**, and it **raises no new decision number and no new
option**. **D5.0-13 / OD-66 option A's content does not change**: R9 corrects the
*description* of a Linux permission check that option A's design already depended
on — `FS_IOC_SETFLAGS` needs the caller to own the inode or hold `CAP_FOWNER` as
well as `CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE` — so no artifact, authority, column, refusal code or
cost of option A moves. **Option A-2** (an independent authenticated host-bound
value) is preserved unchanged and remains **not adopted**; options **B**, **C**
and **D** are unchanged. What does change is input to the ruling rather than part
of it: the threat model that prices option A grows from nine authorities to
**eleven**, eleven of thirteen falsification rows gain a prerequisite that makes
each alteration **harder** to construct, the Security Reviewer's estimate rises to
**3.5–4.5** reviewer-days, assumption **A-5.0-5** is corrected and remains
unconfirmed, and the PERT estimate rises to **40.9**. The Security Reviewer
remains unnamed; Package 5.0 remains `not ready`; implementation is unauthorized.

**Superseded — revision-9 independent re-review, 2026-08-30 — remediation R9 required.**
D5.0-9 / OD-62 through D5.0-13 / OD-66 remain **Open** and must not be ruled
from revision 9. The review accepts none of revision 9 as authority and adds no
decision: its authority model omits the owner-or-`CAP_FOWNER` prerequisite for
`FS_IOC_SETFLAGS` and contradicts itself about whether A3 confers A2. Revision
10 must correct the model and evidence under remediation R9. The Security
Reviewer remains unnamed; Package 5.0 remains `not ready`; implementation is
unauthorized.

**Superseded — remediation R8 submitted, 2026-08-30.** D5.0-9 / OD-62 through D5.0-13 / OD-66
remain **Open** and **must not be ruled from revision 9**. Revision 9 of the
package plan and the logical schema is **documentation and design only**, it
**claims no finding closed**, and it **raises no new decision number**.
**D5.0-13 / OD-66 option A's content changes in two places** — the deployment
digest becomes a value `init-generation` **computes at C0 and compares against
the deployed manifest** before anything consumes it (new §2.13.2c), and the
transient probe directories acquire an explicit **three-state cleanup contract**
whose failed-cleanup state **refuses and reports rather than cleaning**, which
**removes** a code path revision 8 had. Neither adds an artifact, an authority, a
column or a refusal code. **A new option A-2 is raised inside D5.0-13**: option A
**plus an independent authenticated host-bound value** — a TPM-sealed or
coordinator-signed host token — which is the only thing that would make
package-plan **F-7** a refusal instead of residual **R-5.0-13**. It **would** add
a seal field, a V-W step, a coordinator comparison, a refusal code, a §2.13.6
condition and a database column, and its principal price is that a **legitimate
restore onto replacement hardware fails closed**. Because it changes the design
surface it is **routed to the Acceptance Authority under §0.2 and is not
adopted**; revision 9 takes option A with the residual stated instead. **Options
B, C and D, the owners, the authorities and retention rule N5.0-23 are unchanged.
D5.0-9, D5.0-10, D5.0-11 and D5.0-12 are untouched, and no numeric control is
added.** The Security Reviewer remains **unnamed**; the security-review estimate
rises to **3.0–4.0 reviewer-days** with **no added surface**, and the reviewer
inherits a **second** unrefused residual, **R-5.0-13**, alongside R-5.0-12 and
the new operator-recovery state **R-5.0-14**. The entries below record impacts,
not approvals.

Status date: 2026-08-30 (Package 5.0 design remediation **R8** submitted for
independent re-review; it claims no finding closed; all Package 5.0 open
decisions retain their prior owners and status; no option approved.)

**Superseded — revision-8 independent re-review update, 2026-08-30.** D5.0-9 / OD-62 through
D5.0-13 / OD-66 remain **Open** and must not be ruled from revision 8. Four
Blocking internal inconsistencies remain in Algorithm C's value ordering, the
cleanup-failure evidence, the K3/K4 DAC boundary and F-7's claimed host-identity
detector. They require remediation R8 and revision 9; they close no decision and
authorize no implementation. The Security Reviewer remains unnamed and Package
5.0 remains `not ready`.

**Superseded — remediation R7 submitted, 2026-08-30.** D5.0-9 / OD-62 through D5.0-13 / OD-66
remain **Open** and **must not be ruled from revision 8**. Revision 8 of the
package plan and the logical schema is **documentation and design only**, it
**claims no finding closed**, and it **raises no new decision number**: none of
the three Blocking corrections introduces a governed choice. **D5.0-13 / OD-66
option A's content changes in three places** — the generation construction gains a
**post-probe validation step** (**C2**) so it can be executed in the order it
states; Stage 4 gains a **second transient directory `…/probe-ro`** and the
positive DAC control **`S4-0`**; and the threat model becomes an **eight-capability
register** in place of two attacker classes. The first and third add no host
artifact at all; the second adds one transient directory to a probe option A
already carries. **All three are corrections to claims, not new capabilities**,
and they are recorded there rather than adopted. **Options B, C and D, the
owners, the authorities and retention rule N5.0-23 are unchanged. D5.0-9,
D5.0-10, D5.0-11 and D5.0-12 are untouched, and no numeric control is added.**
The Security Reviewer remains **unnamed** and gains one surface element
(`…/probe-ro`) and the new residual **R-5.0-12** — the combination of host root
and PostgreSQL superuser authority, which **no check in this design refuses** and
which is recorded for the Acceptance Authority under D5.0-13 rather than
mitigated. The entries below record impacts, not approvals.

Status date: 2026-08-30 (Package 5.0 design remediation **R7** submitted for
independent re-review; it claims no finding closed; all Package 5.0 open
decisions retain their prior owners and status; no option approved.)

**Superseded — revision-7 independent re-review update, 2026-08-30.** D5.0-9 / OD-62 through
D5.0-13 / OD-66 retain their prior owners and remain Open. Revision 7 cannot be
used to rule them because its creation order, sandbox-attribution evidence and
attacker-capability model remain internally inconsistent. Remediation R7 and
another independent re-review are required before readiness, implementation or
any ruling.

**Remediation R6 submitted, 2026-08-30.** D5.0-9 / OD-62 through D5.0-13 /
OD-66 remain **Open** and **must not be ruled from revision 7**. Revision 7 of
the package plan and the logical schema is **documentation and design only**, it
**claims no finding closed**, and it **raises no new decision number**: the
probe-evidence lifecycle question the R6 handoff put — bind the sandbox stage
into the immutable report, or split it into a second typed artifact — was a
choice of *where* evidence lives inside **D5.0-13 / OD-66 option A**, which is
already open, so it is recorded there as an amended option-A content and is
**not** adopted. **D5.0-13 / OD-66 option A's content changes in two places** —
the probe's sandbox stage moves to provisioning, inside the sealed report, and
the seal's binding section holds three authenticated fields instead of five, two
of which no verifier read — and both are corrections to revision-6 claims rather
than new capabilities. **Options B, C and D, the owners, the authorities and
retention rule N5.0-23 are unchanged.** **D5.0-9, D5.0-10, D5.0-11 and D5.0-12
are untouched, and no numeric control is added.** The Security Reviewer remains
unnamed and gains one surface element. The entries below record impacts, not
approvals.

OD-62 and D5.0-13 / OD-66 remained Open and were not to be ruled from revision

the later deployment-time sandbox stage, and V-W did not support F-1's claim

contradicted the W9/W17 order.

## Package 5.0 decisions — ruled 2026-08-29

Raised by the package 5.0 readiness and design submission and ruled by Peter
Duscha on Codex's independent recommendation. Full statements,
options and reasoning are in
[`../review/phase-5-0-package-plan.md`](../review/phase-5-0-package-plan.md) §5.2;
the schema consequences are in
[`../review/phase-5-0-logical-schema.md`](../review/phase-5-0-logical-schema.md).
Each accepted ruling is recorded in
[`../discovery/open-decisions.md`](../discovery/open-decisions.md) with an OD
number while retaining its local `D5.0-n` traceability reference.

**Current-row override, 2026-09-02:** the historical rows below that label
D5.0-11, D5.0-12 or D5.0-13 Open are superseded by the current decision update
at the top of this register. They are Closed as OD-64 A, OD-65 B and OD-66
A/J-1 respectively. D5.0-9 / OD-62 remains Open; G-A is provisional only.

| Decision | Status | Question | Accountable role | Required before | Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D5.0-1 / OD-54 | **Closed** | Persist a Package 5.0 control plane | Product Owner / Acceptance Authority | before implementation | **Yes.** P5.0-R2 is closed; P5.0-R1 and P5.0-R4 must close before schema acceptance. Remediation R2 reduces the control plane from six tables to **five** by withdrawing the lease and acknowledgement tables |
| D5.0-2 / OD-55 | **Closed** | Placement of comparison telemetry | Product Owner | before implementation | **Package 5.1** creates the table and write path with its first real shadow consumer; 5.0 delivers the common contract only |
| D5.0-3 / OD-56 | **Closed** | `character_id` in comparison telemetry | Data Owner | Package 5.1 schema | Permitted as an internal UUID only, with restricted access, approved retention, and no names, Discord IDs, values, exception text or arbitrary payloads; Security Reviewer confirmation remains required at that package's gate |
| D5.0-4 / OD-57 | **Closed** | Numeric cutover controls | Product Owner / Operations Owner | contract completion | Approved as proposed, except that fewer than 30 comparisons requires a separately approved package-specific threshold before shadowing begins |
| D5.0-5 / OD-58 | **Closed** | Durable ledger ownership | Data Owner / Acceptance Authority | Package 5.2 readiness | The durable ledger table belongs to **5.2** |
| D5.0-6 / OD-59 | **Closed** | Authority-change surface | Product Owner | Package 5.0 implementation | Host-local Platform-Administrator operator command only; no web or Discord mutation surface |
| D5.0-7 / OD-60 | **Closed** | Non-human scope | Product Owner | Package 5.0 implementation | No new service-principal scope in 5.0; reconsider only with a concrete consumer, initially 5.3 |
| D5.0-8 / OD-61 | **Closed 2026-08-31** | Named roles | Delivery Lead / Acceptance Authority | readiness | Claude designated implementer/working Technical Lead; Codex designated Independent Reviewer, logical-schema reviewer and — **named by Peter Duscha 2026-08-31** — **Security Reviewer**. Compatible with §0.3 because Codex did not implement the package; the resulting concentration of design and security judgement in one reviewer is accepted knowingly. **The assignment approves no option and closes no finding**, and the distinct §9.2 security pass (3.5–4.5 reviewer-days, eleven surfaces) is still outstanding |
| **D5.0-9 / OD-62** | **Open — reframed a third time 2026-08-29; blocks WP-4b and must await R4** | **No barrier exists, so what is accepted in place of one?** G-A the drain-first boundary with an enumerable unresolved set, fail-closed activation, containment and detection; G-B pre-cutover write-path retirement; G-C an acknowledged quiet period; or G-D no Sheet-authoritative cutover at all | **Acceptance Authority** and Product Owner, with the Operations Owner and the Security Reviewer | before Package 5.0 WP-4b, and only after P5.0-R5 is remediated and re-reviewed | **Not ruled.** Remediation R3 traced thirteen candidate barriers against the published Sheets v4 and Drive v3 surface and concludes **none proves that a request Google accepted before the fence is reflected before the final import reads**. Revision 3's enforceability claim is withdrawn. **This is now a risk acceptance, not a cost choice**: G-A, G-B and G-C each require accepting an unprovable residual on the authoritative store of a live community's game state. Revision-4 re-review additionally found that G-A's journal can falsely appear clear because it is on volatile `/run` and its lifecycle is unspecified. **Remediation R4, submitted 2026-08-29, rebuilds that control** — durable root-owned storage on a filesystem that was read rather than inferred, a sealed and registered generation, a hash chain, twenty-one fail-closed conditions and a privileged lifecycle — and states plainly that **none of it is a barrier and R-5.0-8 is not narrowed by a single case**. **Peter must still not decide among the options until the Independent Reviewer accepts that the enumeration control is fail-closed.** Both earlier framings are withdrawn and retained as decision history. **Remediation R5, 2026-08-30, records impacts and decides nothing.** Revision 6 makes G-A's enumeration control *creatable* — the revision-5 seal could not be built as specified — and makes its evidence attributable rather than asserted, but it changes **no cost, topology, authority, retention or failure behaviour** in a way that favours one option over another, and **it is still not a barrier**. The residual **R-5.0-8 is not narrowed by a single case**. Peter must still not decide until the Independent Reviewer accepts that the control is fail-closed |
| **D5.0-10 / OD-63** | **Open — extended to nine 2026-08-29; blocks WP-1 completion** | N5.0-14, N5.0-16, N5.0-17, N5.0-18, N5.0-19 and N5.0-20 carry forward unchanged from revision 4; **N5.0-21 new** (minimum free space on the journal filesystem below which the writer refuses to dispatch, 1 GiB); **N5.0-22 new** (maximum current-journal size before a privileged rotation, 64 MiB); **N5.0-23 new** (retention of a sealed archived generation — until plan §15.1's gate and not less than 365 days) | Operations Owner / Product Owner | before Package 5.0 WP-1 completes | **Not ruled.** N5.0-9 … N5.0-13 and N5.0-15 remain withdrawn with the lease. Two of the four revision-3 controls were described as bounds they cannot be, and were reframed rather than re-valued. **WP-13 is demoted**: it informs N5.0-18's margin and closes nothing, so the coupling to D5.0-9 is weaker than it was. **Remediation R4 adds three storage-lifecycle numbers.** N5.0-23 is the only number in the register whose owner is the **Data Owner**, because it decides when a record of what the platform wrote to a live community's Sheet may be destroyed. **Unchanged by remediation R5**, which adds no numeric control: the probe version, the arena and the retry behaviour are all design constants, not operator-set thresholds. **Unchanged again by remediation R6**, which likewise adds none: the probe's stage ordering, its `systemd-run` substitution and the seal binding's field set are design constants. The count stays at **nine** |
| **D5.0-11 / OD-64** | **Open — extended 2026-08-29; blocks WP-2 and WP-14** | Is `freedom_migration_coordinator` introduced **together with** the dedicated `freedomcoord` operating-system identity, the `pg_hba.conf` ordering, the single `pg_ident.conf` map, the `sudoers` execution boundary and the root-owned deployment path? | Product Owner / Operations Owner, on the Security Reviewer's review | before Package 5.0 WP-2 and WP-14 | **Not ruled.** Remediation R3 supplies the specification the re-review required. **Approving the role without the host boundary would approve a control that does not exist**, so the two halves are one decision. Unlike the revision-3 framing this **does** change the accepted topology, which is why it is raised rather than adopted. Option D remains the original P5.0-R4 finding |
| **D5.0-12 / OD-65** | **Open — new 2026-08-29; blocks WP-4b and WP-14** | The host changes the boundary requires outside the coordinator: a dedicated `freedomsheet` identity with the Google credential relocated to it; hardening directives on the live `freedom-bot` unit (Phase 0 finding F-3); and a ruling on the group-writable repository tree that lets every service identity edit every module | Operations Owner / Product Owner, on the Security Reviewer's review | before Package 5.0 WP-4b and WP-14 | **Not ruled.** Two of the three are pre-existing conditions the design would otherwise rely on silently. Package 5.0 **works around** the repository permissions with a root-owned deployment path rather than fixing them, because fixing them is wider than this package; the workaround is sufficient for the coordinator and does not make the condition acceptable. **Extended by remediation R5** to a **third system group**, `freedomjournal`, holding exactly `freedomcoord` and `freedomsheet` and carrying **no database privilege**. It exists so the writer can *read* the seal it is required to validate while `…/journal` tightens from `0751` to `root:freedomjournal 0750` — so the net effect is a **narrower** grant than revision 5 had: `discordbot` and `freedomweb` lose even directory traverse. A world-readable `0444` seal was considered and rejected for exactly that reason. The group is an operating-system change and is the Operations Owner's to approve |
| **D5.0-13 / OD-66** | **Open — new 2026-08-29; blocks WP-4b and WP-15** | The dispatch journal's durable storage, generation lifecycle and evidence-disposal authority — four things ruled together: the root-owned hierarchy at `/var/lib/freedom-sheet-writer`, deliberately **not** systemd's `StateDirectory=`, which would make the writer own the directory holding its own evidence; the sealed generation and its PostgreSQL registration in a **sixth table**, without which the activation trigger cannot refuse stale or cross-generation evidence; the privileged `freedom-journal-admin` lifecycle under a **second `sudoers` drop-in that runs as root**; and the retention and disposal rule N5.0-23 | Operations Owner and **Data Owner**, on the Security Reviewer's review | before Package 5.0 WP-4b and WP-15 | **Not ruled.** Raised by design remediation R4 in response to Blocking finding P5.0-R5. Options **J-1** (the full contract, recommended), **J-2** (durable storage without the PostgreSQL registration, so the stale-evidence check exists only in the coordinator command), **J-3** (**drop `dispatch_journal_clear` and the journal entirely** — the honest alternative to revision 4's contradiction, which removes the only control that refuses a cutover when a request is *known* outstanding, and is Peter's to take rather than the implementer's), and **J-4** (keep the `/run` journal, which is the finding). **Option A carries a named cost, R-5.0-11**: a full or failing journal filesystem stops Sheet mutations until an operator acts. **Option A is re-stated by remediation R5 and is what would be ruled on**: the acyclic seal-body/genesis/seal-digest construction, the minimum read-only seal grant through `freedomjournal`, the four-stage disposable-arena capability probe with privileged cleanup, and an attested probe report in place of the **withdrawn** `CHECK (append_only_verified)`. J-1 remains recommended and J-2 is now marginally less bad than it was, because more of the check is derivable on the host; J-3 and J-4 are unchanged. R-5.0-11 grows with the fail-closed conditions, from twenty-one to **twenty-five**. **Option A's content is amended again by remediation R6, in two places and no others, and is again what would be ruled on**: the capability probe's **sandbox stage moves from deployment to provisioning**, inside the same `verify-capability` invocation and before the report is sealed — which adds a transient `systemd-run` unit started **as root** and a requirement that the writer's unit file be deployed, and removes a deployment-time step — and the seal's **binding section holds three authenticated fields instead of five**, `sealed_at` and the binding's own format field being withdrawn because no verifier read either. **Both are corrections to revision-6 claims, not new capabilities.** J-1 remains recommended; **J-2 is worse than revision 6 made it look**, because the registered row is now identified as the only artifact that refuses a privileged rewrite of the seal *and* the journal's record 0 (falsification case F-1b); J-3 and J-4 are unchanged, as are the owners, the authorities and N5.0-23. The Security Reviewer's scope gains the transient root-started unit, without a change to the 2.5–3.5 reviewer-day estimate. **Option A's content is amended again by remediation R7**, in two places: Stage 4 gains an **exact target `…/probe-ro/s4-2.target` in a second transient directory** and the **positive DAC control `S4-0`**, and the construction gains a **post-probe validation step C2**. **And again by remediation R8**, in two places and no others: the deployment digest becomes a value **computed at C0 and compared against the deployed manifest** before anything consumes it (§2.13.2c), and the transient directories acquire a **three-state cleanup contract** whose failed-cleanup state **refuses and reports rather than cleaning** — which **removes** a code path rather than adding one. **Neither R8 movement adds an artifact, an authority, a column or a refusal code.** **A new option A-2 is raised by remediation R8 and is what R8-D routes rather than adopts**: option A **plus an independent authenticated host-bound value** — a TPM-sealed or coordinator-signed host token — which is the only thing that would make falsification row **F-7** a refusal instead of residual **R-5.0-13**. It **would** add a seal field, a **V-W** step, a coordinator comparison, a refusal code beyond `SW-J25`, a §2.13.6 condition and a column in `sheet_writer_journal_generations`, and its principal price is that a **legitimate restore onto replacement hardware fails closed** in a design whose purpose is that evidence survives a restore. Because it changes the design surface it is the Acceptance Authority's under §0.2, on the Security Reviewer's and the Operations Owner's advice; **the implementer does not adopt it.** J-1 remains recommended; J-2, J-3 and J-4, the owners, the authorities and N5.0-23 are unchanged. The Security Reviewer's estimate rises to **3.0–4.0 reviewer-days** with **no added surface**, because the threat model is now nine authorities whose combinations must each be checked against real Unix DAC and there are now **two** unrefused residuals. **No new decision number is raised. Still not ruled** |

**Package 5.0 remains `not ready`.** D5.0-1 through D5.0-7 are closed. D5.0-8
remains open only for the Security Reviewer. Codex's remediation-R1 re-review
closed P5.0-R2, kept P5.0-R1 Blocking and raised Blocking P5.0-R4; the
remediation-R2 re-review kept both Blocking; the remediation-R3 re-review kept
P5.0-R1 Blocking and raised Blocking P5.0-R5. **Design remediation R4 was
submitted on 2026-08-29 and claims no finding closed** — for P5.0-R5 it replaces
the dispatch journal's storage, identity, integrity format, failure states and
privileged lifecycle and resolves the completeness contradiction by withdrawing
the false statement rather than the control; for P5.0-R4 it leaves the boundary
unchanged and claims no operational evidence passed; for P5.0-R1's Sheet half it
repeats that no barrier exists in the published Google APIs and returns a priced
decision. **The revision-5 re-review on 2026-08-29 kept P5.0-R5 Blocking**, on
four grounds: a circular seal/genesis construction, a writer denied the seal it
was told to validate, a capability probe that could not distinguish append-only
enforcement from ordinary permissions, and a Boolean database check credited with
proving a host fact. **Design remediation R5 was submitted on 2026-08-30 and
likewise claims no finding closed**; revision 6 corrects all four, and **P5.0-R4
stays open** pending security and operational evidence while P5.0-R2 stays
closed. **D5.0-9, D5.0-10, D5.0-11, D5.0-12 and D5.0-13 are open, each blocking
a work package.** Assumption A-5.0-3 (disposable Google resources) is
unconfirmed; **A-5.0-4 — a disposable operating-system identity and a `pg_hba`
reload — is unconfirmed and without it the whole R3-B evidence plan is
unproducible**; and **A-5.0-5 — a root-owned durable journal hierarchy, a
disposable probe arena, a `setpriv` identity drop and a *verified* `chattr +a` —
is unconfirmed and without it no capability probe can run, no generation can be
initialised and P5.0-R5 cannot close on evidence.**

**One open item cannot be resolved by a further design pass.** The barrier
P5.0-R1's Sheet half asks for does not exist in the published Google APIs, and
making the dispatch journal durable does not create one. What closes that half is
Peter's ruling on D5.0-9, or the Independent Reviewer evidencing a published
mechanism the search missed.

**One open item is genuinely the Data Owner's.** N5.0-23, inside D5.0-13, decides
when a sealed record of what the platform wrote to a live community's Sheet may be
destroyed. It is the first number in this package whose owner is not the
Operations Owner or the Product Owner.

| OD-17 | **Closed 2026-08-12** | Product Owner / Security Reviewer | Phase 3 planning | Attribute legacy mutations through the Phase 3 gate; the first post-acceptance deployment requires verified `character_access` and precedes every later feature deployment |

| OD-39 | Open | Product Owner / Security Reviewer | Phase 5.7/5.8 cutover | Close unauthenticated trade/sale mutation policy and interim control |
| OD-41 | **Closed 2026-08-02** | Product Owner / Acceptance Authority | Phase 2 remediation | ADR 0008 rejected; the controlled migration register assigns every Sheet-era field, including `character.downtime_progress`, to one typed owning package |
| OD-42 | **Closed 2026-08-02** | Data Owner / Acceptance Authority | Phase 2 remediation plan approval | Ruled: display names are not unique identities; multiple characters may share one; stable character IDs and external Actor IDs provide identity; any legacy name-based candidate lookup fails closed when more than one candidate exists. **No unique display-name constraint is added.** Closes I-05. Package R2 corrects the single-value claim lookup to return every candidate and refuse on more than one |
| OD-43 | **Closed 2026-08-13; design accepted at P3.G0** | Product Owner / Security Reviewer / Acceptance Authority | Phase 3 P3.G0 | Peter accepted [ADR 0010](../adr/0010-provider-neutral-identity-and-emergency-administration.md) and the complete remediated P3.0 baseline after Codex architecture/security re-review. Acceptance includes corrected N-43, widened N-65, new N-67, account-aware audit attribution, mapping provenance and R-38. P3.1 is authorized subject to its disposable-PostgreSQL readiness condition. |
| OD-44 | **Closed 2026-08-14** | Product Owner / Security Reviewer / Acceptance Authority | Phase 3 P3.G1 | Peter approved the durable one-way OAuth completion binding in the [I-07 decision](../review/phase-3-p3-1-sm-01-completion-binding-decision.md): a unique, required `sessions.oauth_transaction_id` for Discord OAuth plus an atomic `completion_claimed_at` claim in the provider-I/O-free session transaction. No reverse `oauth_transactions.session_id` is added. **Implemented 2026-08-14** as migration 0009 with the required PostgreSQL concurrency, constraint, rollback and mutation evidence; the unique index is scoped to non-rotated sessions so N-08 rotation remains possible, declared for confirmation in `../review/phase-3-p3-1-od-44-remediation-submission.md`. **Confirmed 2026-08-14** (decision record §8): Peter approves that scoped index as the authoritative interpretation, conditionally on rotation integrity — one successor per predecessor, a rotation's account, authentication method and OAuth binding equal to its predecessor's, only a live unrotated predecessor rotatable, atomic insert-and-revoke, deterministic concurrent rotation, no arbitrary session labellable a rotation, and break-glass rotations unbound. The same ruling covers the re-review finding that the claim did not bind the provider. Implemented 2026-08-14 in migration 0009 and the OAuth, session and provider boundaries; see `../review/phase-3-p3-1-od-44-provider-binding-remediation-submission.md`. Independent and distinct security re-review remain required. |
| OD-45 | **Closed 2026-08-14** | Product Owner / Acceptance Authority | Phase 3 P3.G1/P3.G2 | Peter approved the [I-08 allocation](../review/phase-3-p3-1-tc-bg-05-http-evidence-decision.md): service/constraint portions remain at P3.G1; direct-HTTP portions of TC-BG-05b/c/e are mandatory blocking evidence at P3.G2 against the real P3.2 routes. This is not a waiver and does not authorize early P3.2 work. |
| OD-46 | **Closed 2026-08-17; operational input confirmed** | Product Owner / Acceptance Authority | Phase 3 P3.G2 | Peter resolved the controlled-contract contradiction over where the Sheet-era identity link is written, in favour of **immediate activation**: an R-29 Guild Council confirmation creates the `character_access` row atomically with its audit events, and command **C-05 is withdrawn**. The same ruling records Google Sheets as temporary legacy migration input with no platform-runtime dependency, requires C-04's player-tab name to be supplied explicitly, and requires the duplicate-player-name defect to fail closed by refusing the whole C-04 run. Peter subsequently confirmed the one-time tab name as **`Players`**; `--player-tab Players` remains required and is not portal configuration. See [C-P3.2-A and C-P3.2-B](change-log.md) and the corrected contract text in `../contracts/phase-3-identity-migration-contract.md` §7.2–§7.7. **Extended 2026-08-17 by [C-P3.2-C](change-log.md):** the independent implementation review found that R-28 read a proposal's historical `confirmed` resolution as proof the link was still active, so a link revoked through R-26 was reported as active and counted as one. Peter ruled that §7.4's *"`confirmed` counts active links"* sentence stands and a **balanced `confirmed_revoked` bucket** is added beside it, with VM-10 reporting each confirmation's own link state from the exact `granted_access_id`. The confirmation itself is never rewritten and no decision state is added. **P3.G2 is not approved by any of these rulings** and remains open pending independent and security-focused re-review. |
| OD-47 | **Deferred 2026-08-17** | Product Owner / Security Reviewer | after Phase 3 | Whether one platform account may hold two active Discord identities. Retained deliberately under C-P3.2-A: the current behaviour fails closed (`AmbiguousProviderIdentity` answers `503` rather than guessing whose roles decide the account's capability), and that is the safe state to defer in. No schema constraint is added and none is removed. |

**OD-44 addendum, 2026-08-15 (no decision changed).** The OD-44 ruling's condition
that "only a live unrotated predecessor" may be rotated is recorded here as having
required two corrections to be true of the implementation, both now made and
neither yet re-reviewed: the rotation liveness predicates on 2026-08-14, and the
same class in the idle refresh on 2026-08-15, which additionally applied N-06's
idle window to break-glass sessions. The clarified reading of N-07, N-08 and N-15
that follows from the ruling is recorded in the numeric policy register; **no
accepted numeric value changed**, so this is an addendum and not a change request
under that register's §5. See
`../review/phase-3-p3-1-od-44-session-lifetime-remediation-submission.md`.
Independent and distinct security re-review still block P3.G1.

**OD-44 addendum continued, 2026-08-15 later the same day (no decision changed).**
Codex's independent implementation and security re-reviews of that submission
returned one blocking finding: the idle-policy correction had been made in the
session service while the repository API still accepted a refresh duration and an
authentication method as independent arguments, so N-15's 15-minute window could
still be bypassed by a caller naming a break-glass row's true method beside N-06's
duration. The correction removes the duration from the API at both layers and
selects it inside the atomic statement from the persisted `auth_method`, using an
immutable validated policy injected once at the composition root. **No accepted
numeric value changed and no decision changed**; N-06 and N-15 keep their values and
configuration remains their source. This also reverses one alternative recorded as
rejected in change record C-P3.1-G — "deriving the idle duration inside the
repository" — on the ground that the objection was to adapter-owned *constants*,
not to configuration-owned policy consumed by the adapter. See
`../review/phase-3-p3-1-od-44-session-touch-policy-remediation-submission.md`.
Independent and distinct security re-review still block P3.G1.

**OD-44 addendum continued, 2026-08-15, third entry of that day (no decision
changed).** Codex's independent re-review of the preceding submission returned one
blocking finding, and it is the same authority in a third position rather than a
new one. Removing `idle` and `expected_auth_method` from the repository API had
moved the method-to-duration pairing into `SessionIdlePolicy`'s public dataclass
constructor: a complete, duplicate-free, positive mapping assigning N-06's
60-minute window to *every* method satisfied every invariant that constructor
validated, so a repository built with it selected 60 minutes for persisted
WebAuthn and recovery-grant rows and N-15's 15-minute limit was bypassed again, up
to the 60-minute emergency absolute bound. Two statements in the preceding
submission — that no supported API could pair a method with another policy's
duration, and that policy was built once and injected — were false; the second was
false of the composition as well, since `SessionService` derived its own policy
while `WebComposition.services()` derived another for the repository. The
correction closes construction rather than adding a predicate: the policy has no
public constructor, its only factory takes `SessionSettings`, the mapping is
derived internally from `AuthMethod.is_break_glass`, and one instance is built at
the composition root and injected into both the repository and the service.
**No accepted numeric value changed and no decision changed**; N-06 and N-15 keep
their values, `SessionSettings` remains their sole source, and every pair of
values the configuration contract accepts — including an ordinary window shorter
than the emergency one — maps by method classification. No schema change and no
migration edit was required. See
`../review/phase-3-p3-1-od-44-session-idle-policy-construction-remediation-submission.md`.
Independent and distinct security re-review still block P3.G1.

**OD-44 addendum continued, 2026-08-15, fourth entry of that day (no decision
changed).** Codex's independent re-review of the preceding submission returned
three counterexamples that survived it, and their combined lesson is recorded here
because it changed the *shape* of the implementation rather than a decision. (F1)
`from_settings()` validated only positivity while `SessionSettings` was a public
frozen dataclass with no construction-time validation, so an out-of-register
settings object was accepted and the derived policy gave both break-glass methods
sixty minutes; closing the policy's constructor was beside the point while the
numbers it read were unconstrained. (F2) The refresh SQL was generated by
iterating the policy's public, overridable `__iter__`, so a subclass inheriting
the supported factory replaced the mapping the database used while the
service-facing method still reported fifteen minutes — ordinary Python
subclassing, which the preceding submission wrongly characterised as out-of-scope
forgery. (F3) `SessionService` accepted a policy beside the repository and
required no relationship between them, so correct production wiring was a
convention rather than an invariant. The correction removes the extensible
boundary instead of guarding it: `SessionIdlePolicy` is deleted, `SessionSettings`
enforces the accepted register in its own constructor, `SessionRepository` derives
and owns the bounds, `SessionService` reads the repository's, and which window a
method receives is an explicit classification table that refuses an unclassified
method at startup rather than defaulting it. **No accepted numeric value changed,
no decision changed, no configuration variable was renamed and no deployment value
moved**; N-04, N-06, N-07, N-15 and N-66 keep their values and `SessionSettings`
remains their sole source, now validated at every construction rather than only at
environment load. No schema change and no migration edit was required. See
`../review/phase-3-p3-1-od-44-session-bounds-construction-remediation-submission.md`.
Independent and distinct security re-review still block P3.G1.

**OD-44 addendum continued, 2026-08-15, fifth entry of that day (no decision
changed).** Codex's independent re-review of the preceding submission returned
**one** blocking counterexample, described from two perspectives — F1 in the
implementation review and S1 in the distinct security-focused pass. It is recorded
here because it is a lesson about where an accepted policy is *defined*, not about
what it says. `SESSION_CEILINGS` had given both enforcement gates the same bounds
and left each to state independently what a value of these fields may **be**:
`SessionSettings.__post_init__` required an actual `int`, never a `bool`, positive
and within its ceiling, while the derived-policy gate restated the rule as the two
ordering comparisons `value < 1` and `value > ceiling`. Two ordering comparisons
are not a whole-number rule — `float("nan")` makes both false — so a non-finite
`max_sessions_per_account` survived `SessionPolicy.derive()` and
`len(live) >= maximum` was false for every live-session count, leaving **N-66
inoperative**. The route was ordinary: `derive()` accepts `SessionSettings`
subclasses deliberately, so a subclass whose inherited `__post_init__` observes
the valid stored integer can answer differently on the single later derivation
read. The correction makes the rule **one runtime definition** rather than a third
restatement: `session_policy_problem`/`session_policy_problems` live beside
`SESSION_CEILINGS` in `application/web/config.py`, and both gates call them; the
accepted type is recorded in the numeric policy register as `int` and never
`bool`, with floats refused as a class. **No accepted numeric value changed and no
decision changed**; N-04, N-06, N-07, N-15 and N-66 keep their values and their
sole source. No schema change and no migration edit was required. See
`../review/phase-3-p3-1-od-44-session-policy-numeric-validation-remediation-submission.md`.
Independent and distinct security re-review still block P3.G1.

## Baseline v1.7 — Freedom bot retirement, 2026-08-28

| OD | Decision | Ruling | Affects |
|---|---|---|---|
| OD-53 | Is the Freedom bot retained after the platform is complete? | **No.** The bot is deleted at the end of the migration, once the platform provides every player-facing behavior it provides and a player needs no manual step beyond required Council confirmations. Discord itself is **not** retired: OAuth authentication, guild/role verification, events, notifications and voice-state attendance evidence remain | `.agents/AGENTS.md` direction and non-deletion rule; plan §12.0 and new §15.2 with a terminal gate; Phase 8 must size the gateway presence attendance needs. **Phase 4 unaffected** |

## Phase 4 decisions ruled 2026-08-28

| OD | Decision | Ruling | Affects |
|---|---|---|---|
| OD-48 | Does Phase 4 add a physical ledger table? | **No.** Ledger in `domain/` plus a consumer-owned protocol and an in-memory reference adapter; durable idempotency reuses the existing `idempotency_keys` table under a Phase-4 scope. No migration, so the mandatory logical-schema artifact is not triggered | Phase 4 "transaction ledger"; the conditional PostgreSQL constraint/append-only/runtime-role evidence is reallocated to package 5.0 or 5.2 |
| OD-49 | The downtime unit in the shared domain | **Integer thousandth-days**, refusing anything else; Phase 4 leaves `/info`'s legacy rendering unchanged and creates no read adapter | Phase 4 value object; package 5.5 owns Sheet conversion, invalid-value handling and the real character-page consumer when it migrates Characters column I |
| OD-51 | The float-money defects in `/sale` and `/lc` | **Characterize, do not correct.** Tests record today's behaviour and name the defect and its owning package; no line of either path changes. The rules are verified correct — the defect is the arithmetic type | Phase 4 characterization and risk R-P4-2; packages **5.7** and **5.3** inherit the fix and must reproduce the PDF worked examples in integer copper |
| OD-50 | Are the Sheet's denomination counters a domain concept? | **No.** `domain/` models money as integer copper only; the four counters stay a labelled legacy representation and nothing normalizes a character's coins on read | Phase 4 "money uses integer copper" and the unchanged-output characterization; package 5.2 owns the eventual normalization of Characters P–S |
| OD-52 | The Phase 4 query boundary and `/info` | **Final amendment 2026-08-29: Phase 4 creates neither an `/info` rewrite nor an unconsumed temporary Sheet query/adapter.** The platform replaces `/info` with character pages. Package 5.2 introduces the wallet query and production adapter with that page as its real consumer; package 5.1 owns any transitional bot migration. | Phase 4 evidence comes from ledger/idempotent command execution; package 5.2 wallet read path; risk R-P4-3 remains with 5.1 if it migrates the command |

Recorded as change-log `C-P4-C` through final amendment `C-P4-F`; full rationale in
[`../discovery/open-decisions.md`](../discovery/open-decisions.md) and
[`../review/phase-4-package-plan.md`](../review/phase-4-package-plan.md) §5.
These rulings released the Phase 4 work that was subsequently delivered,
independently reviewed and approved on 2026-08-29 (change-log C-P4-L). P4-R1
through P4-R5 and D-04 are Closed. Phase 5.0 is the next package selected for
readiness planning; no Phase 5 implementation or cutover is authorized by this
decision index.

All other OD entries marked closed or ruled remain decisions, not open actions.
The Delivery Lead reviews this index before baselining every phase. A decision is
closed only when the authoritative OD entry records the ruling, date, rationale
and affected requirements; an implementation does not silently make policy.
